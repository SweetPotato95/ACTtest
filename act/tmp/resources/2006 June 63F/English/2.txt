<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=19> [1]It was a routine Saturday <font id=16>evening. </font> [2] The clattering of pots and pans echoed through the house. [3] <font id=17>As my mother and I prepared dinner, </font> we had our usual conversation about school and life. [4] She grew quiet as I shared my hopes of going away to college. [5] College applications should be completed as early as possible. [6] She looked at me sadly <font id=18>at the age of eighteen</font> and said that I was abandoning our traditions by leaving home. [7] I talked with her about the benefits gained from being independent. [8] She abruptly changed the subject. </font></div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=26> [1] I have <font id=20>as</font> many happy memories of my childhood in Vietnam. [2] I loved our traditional New Year celebrations. <font id=21>21</font>  [3] <font id=22>One</font> would burn paper money for good luck and go from house to house wishing our relatives health and happiness. [4] During the Moon Festival, I would show off the <font id=23>lanterns, </font> my mother had made, <font id=24>eat mooncake, and drink</font> tea with my grandparents. [5] I looked forward to the ocean air and the sound of the waves. [6] My mother <font id=25>walks</font> with me on the wet sand, often buying me something from one of the shops along the beach. </font></div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">But my mother's work as an art dealer has taken us far from home. <font id=27>When we immigrated to Houston, Texas, </font> I learned about the different groups and cultures that make up my high school. <font id=28>Through my friends, I have developed a love for ribs and tacos, alternative rock and hip-hop, mocha cappuccino and skateboarding. </font> I enjoy spending evenings at a local cafe with my classmates, talking and studying together.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">My mother has often asked <font id=29>me; </font> why I don't like to do the things or eat the foods that I did when I was younger. For a long time I could not understand why she was so protective of our Vietnamese traditions. Eventually, I began to understand that her reason for reminding me of our birthplace is to preserve in me a respect for <font id=30>it's</font> culture.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">I still hope to go away to college next year. I also hope my mother is beginning to realize that I will take with me a part of the culture or our family and our home.</div>
