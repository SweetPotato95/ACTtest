<h1>Meaning and Manners</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">While traveling abroad recently, my neighbor <font id=31>experienced a common</font> but poorly understood communication problem. One evening at a restaurant <font id=32>a dish of stuffed mushrooms was ordered</font> with his meal, assuming the dish would be served as an appetizer. When the mushrooms hadn't arrived by the time the main course was served, he asked the waiter, "Are my mushrooms ready yet?" The waiter went to the kitchen and returned <font id=33>in a moment. </font> "Yes, sir, your mushrooms are ready," he said, and then left to wait on another table. <font id=34>In due course, after waiting a while, </font> my neighbor signaled for the waiter and asked him why he still hadn't received his mushrooms. <font id=35>When surprised, </font> the waiter replied that he would be glad to bring the dish when my neighbor requested it. Knowing that the waiter spoke English quite well my neighbor could not understand why the waiter seemed to be acting <font id=36>rude and impolite. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The miscommunication that occurred between my neighbor and the waiter <font id=37>was not related</font> to grammar, pronunciation, or vocabulary. Rather, it resulted from a gap in what sociolinguists call "communicative competence." My neighbor did not understand that requests are communicated <font id=38>different from</font> other cultures the <font id=39>waiter, although</font> fluent in English, did not know bow to interpret this particular request.  <font id=40>40</font>  For many English-speakers from the United States it is considered polite to make a request in the form of a question, but in other languages and cultures, this particular politeness convention is not always used. <font id=42>The waiter bad interpreted <font id=41>my neighbors question</font> as a simple request for information, not as a request to bring the dish. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Without communicative competence, even people who speak the same language can misinterpret each other. It is sometimes as important to learn the politeness conventions used by speakers of other languages and cultures <font id=43>as learning</font> their vocabulary and grammar. <font id=44>44</font> My neighbor's experience illustrates how important it is to <font id=45>be persistent when learning a foreign language. </font></div>
