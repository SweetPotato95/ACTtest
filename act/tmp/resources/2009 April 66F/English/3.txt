<h1>A Few Words about Bats</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The movie Dracula, <font id=31>featuring it's</font> batlike title character who feeds on human blood, is just one of many sources of people's <font id=32>ideas about bats that are flawed.</font> The facts about bats are <font id=33>more interesting than</font> the falsehoods. Just take three of the most common misconceptions about <font id=34>bats;</font> that they are dangerous to humans, that they are rodents, and that they cannot see.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In reality, only three of the more than 850 known species of bats feed primarily on blood, and even these do not draw nourishment from human blood; <font id=35>they bite cattle and horses in their sleep.</font> Most bats eat insects; others feed on fruit, nectar, pollen, small vertebrates, and fish.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Some people believe bats are <font id=36>rodents; others</font> think bats are a kind of bird. Although winged, bats are not related to birds, <font id=37>because even if</font> a bat's small, furry body may appear mouselike, bats are not rodents either. Rather, bats are a unique order of mammals called <font id=38>Chiroptera,</font> the only mammals that <font id=39>truly flies.</font></div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">While some species of bats are blind, most are not. However, bats that hunt at night use sound more than sight to orient themselves in the dark. These bats <font id=40>sending out high-frequency sounds and using</font> the echoes that bounce back from objects to locate their prey and to navigate.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In addition to being fascinating creatures, bats are useful to humans, especially farmers. <font id=41>41</font>They consume beetles and moths that attack crops, reducing our reliance on chemical insecticides; in addition, bat droppings are useful for fertilizing fields and gardens.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">There is one sad piece of news about bats: their habitats are being destroyed by humans. <font id=42>For example, bat caves are being disturbed or ruined as highways and housing developments are built.</font> As a consequence, several bat species face extinction. We should protect bats because, <font id=43>though they might seem threatening,</font> they are an important and beneficial part of life.</div>
