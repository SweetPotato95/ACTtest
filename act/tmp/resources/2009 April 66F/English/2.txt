<h1>Working at the Bait & Tackle Shop</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[1]  Most folks who live in our little bayside village work at a job having something to do with fishing or tourism, and I'm no different.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[2]  The shop opens at six in the <font id=16>morning,</font> I arrive thirty minutes early to set up. On many mornings, the sky is adorned with peach-and-melon-colored <font id=17>ribbons as</font> a blazing <font id=18>solar</font> sun begins to peek over the horizon. Walking toward the docks, <font id=19>the seagulls are wheeling and swooping. Their</font> high-pitched cries sound like rusty door hinges.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[3] Usually, as I'm opening the door, <font id=20>Carney, the night security guard at the marina,</font> walks by on his way home and offers me a sleepy hello.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[4]  The shop smells salty, like the <font id=21>bay, itself</font> and the creaky oak floor is gritty with sand. I turn on the <font id=22>lights in the middle</font> of the shop <font id=23>sits</font> wooden bins filled with sinkers, floats, and lures. <font id=24>The wide variety of fishing equipment, attracts both the serious angler and the casual vacationer.</font> If I notice any merchandise out of place, I <font id=25>straighten it</font> up.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[5]  Next, I turn on the electric urn to heat water for hot lea, and I start a fresh pot of coffee. <font id=26>When I fill</font> the bowl of sugar cubes, take the lid off the powdered creamer, and add tea bags to the assortment in the basket on the counter I remove the cash drawer from the safe and put it in the cash register.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=28>[6]  [1] Then, from the walk-in cooler, I drag bushels of bait clams to the counter. [2] I make sure the buckets of <font id=27>live herring, mullet,</font> and shrimp are filled. [3] Since they're sold by the baker's dozen, I fill Styrofoam containers with a bit of the grass and thirteen worms. [4] If it's a particularly nice day, or if the fish have been biting, I might prepare extra containers. [5] I pull out a large cardboard flat of worms packed in moist grass.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[7]   By this time, it's nearly six o'clock. I open the window blinds, unlock the front door, and greet the first customers <font id=29>with a smile</font>. If it's nippy outside, I offer them a complimentary cup of hot coffee or tea to help them start their day.</div>
