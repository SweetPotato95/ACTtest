<h1>Creek Walk</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">On summer afternoons, my <font id=31>sister and</font> I used to go on creek walks. Starting near the barn, we'd slide down an embankment into a stream that bisected the family <font id=32>farm. The</font> water ran clear and foot-numbingly cold. We'd set off, walking downstream with the current, <font id=33>skipping</font> under overhanging foliage. Our dogs trotted reassuringly at our heels, drinking from pools and splashing through the shallows. Cicadas buzzed in the hot Kentucky air. <font id=34>34</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">And always, we looked for fossils.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=37> [1] But once our eyes had adjusted to the task, they were <font id=35>unmistakable: perfectly</font> formed little stone disks. [2] Our father told us they were 'fossilized crinoids. [3] Some were embedded in larger stones, while others were loose among the pebbles. [4] Still others, the best ones, were cylinders as fat as my thumb, with hollow star-shaped centers, <font id=36>they're</font> outlines as distinct as when the crinoids were alive. [5] When either of us located such a treasure. We'd snatch it up and crow, "Got one!" [6] At first, they were hard co see. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=38>Growing up</font> in Kentucky, these fossils were common. <font id=39>Eons ago</font> my father taught us that our farm and everything around it had been covered by a tropical sea. Furthermore, in that sea lived a great variety of marine animals, including the <font id=40>crinoids; </font> animals that looked like plants, with brightly colored heads atop segmented stems. The stems attached the crinoids to the ocean floor. I tried to picture the hills around our farm submerged beneath an ocean. I imagined crinoids waving in the current, <font id=41>then</font> sinking into sediment that eventually turned into limestone. <font id=42>Otherwise, the</font> fossils we plucked from the creek were pieces of those ancient stems, <font id=43>freezing</font> in time.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The fossils fascinated us, both because of the <font id=44>span</font> of geologic time they represented and because we could make them into jewelry. We strung them like beads or buttons onto thread <font id=45>to make: necklaces</font> and bracelets. Around our necks and on our wrists, we wore fragments of Earth's history, beautifully preserved.</div>
