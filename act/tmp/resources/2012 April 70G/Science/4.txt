<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Scientists investigated the effect of ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) on the eggs of 3 species of amphibians: Hyla regilla, Rana cascadae, and Bufo boreas. H. regilla populations are stable, but R. cascadae and B. boreas populations are declining.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">First, 1,800 newly laid eggs of H. regilla were collected from a high mountain lake. Next, 150 of the eggs were placed in each of 12 artificial enclosures: 4 that were covered with a filter, FB, that blocked UV-B; 4 that were covered with a filter, FT. that transmitted UV-B; and 4 that were not covered with any filter. Then, a set of these 3 types of enclosures was placed in the lake at each of 4 sites. All of the above procedures were repeated for the other 2 species. The enclosures were monitored until all the eggs had either hatched or died. The percent of total eggs that hatched for each species and type of enclosure is shown in Figure l.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">UV-B damages cells by causing cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CBPDs) to be produced in their DNA.

The photolyase activity (the rate at which CBPDs are removed from DNA) present in the eggs of each of the 3 species was recorded (see Figure 3).</div>
