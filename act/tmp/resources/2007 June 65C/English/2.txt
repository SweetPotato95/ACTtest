<h1>Serving in the Peace Corps</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">After much too long a flight, we lauded. <font id=16>Being that I fully stretched</font> my leas for the first time in twelve hours, I poked my head out the bulkhead door and exclaimed, <font id=17>"This place is hot." I had arrived in Safi, Morocco, a seaport on the Atlantic coast in northwestern Africa.</font> The <font id=18>hot, dry wind,</font> blowing off the desert seemed to <font id=19>melt</font> right through me. I suddenly wished I could duck back inside the air-conditioned 747 and head back home.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">That was how my Peace Corps experience began. A local welcoming committee greeted me, and we shared bowls of sweetened goat's milk and plates of fresh dates. I gratefully accepted their hospitality and satisfied my hunger.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=20>Eventually</font>, when I completed my Peace Corps <font id=21>service, and</font> realized that I had also satisfied my hunger for new experiences. But I'd accomplished much more than that. I had become more adaptable, more perceptive, more self-reliant-in short, more grown up. I'd not only helped people in Morocco but also learned Arabic, developed lifelong friendships, celebrated Islamic holidays, and come to understand and appreciate a culture <font id=22>different from</font> my own. I had known I would be teaching English to teenagers <font id=23>whom were</font> studying to become everything from shipbuilders to chemical engineers. <font id=24>Never imagining</font> that the work would lead to moments of self-discovery. I never dreamed <font id=25>I'd miss my home in the United States as much as I did.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Perhaps the most important thing I learned is that for all the ways in which people all over the world are different, there are just as many ways in which they are alike. This knowledge reassures and inspires <font id=26>me. When</font> I remember that human beings share many of the same <font id=27>hopes, and fears,</font> dreams and disappointments, <font id=28>then I can help my relationships.</font> Perhaps this is a small thing, but no less significant than mastering a new skill or suddenly understanding a concept. After all, it's not what we know that makes us smart but how <font id=29>one chooses</font> to use that knowledge.</div>
