<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Wildflowers thrive in stunning stretches of color along the highways across the United States. In California, poppies spread in dazzling carpets of orange. <font id=31>31</font> In Virginia, pink cosmos accent the <font id=32>landscape, occasionally</font>, these scenic expanses come about with no help from humans. Often, <font id=33>for example,</font> they are the lovely outcome of federal, state, and local programs to restore <font id=34>and preserve the lasting character of</font> the natural beauty of the national landscape.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[2]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=35>The individuals who are passionate about these programs point out that native plants along a roadway do more than beautify the area.</font> Properly selected vegetation absorbs rainwater runoff that might otherwise create hazardous conditions on the highways. <font id=36>The plants also provide habitat for songbirds, butterflies, and other wildlife.</font> Furthermore, highway maintenance costs and <font id=37>pollution decreases</font< in areas planted with native flowers and grasses, which require <font id=38>little, if any,</font> mowing or chemical treatment.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">As a child, Claudia Taylor became deeply attached to the wild beauty of her surroundings. As an adult, she devoted herself to protecting and restoring habitat that she saw rapidly disappearing, In the 1960s, she moved into the White House with her husband, President Lyndon <font id=41>Johnson, by</font> then widely known as "Lady Bird" Johnson, this crusader took a stand for native plants and the wildlife that depend on them. She strongly believed <font id=42>if humans were to</font> benefit immeasurably from beauty in their environment. By working for the passage of the Highway Beautification Act in 1963, she helped create a national <font id=43>legacy to endure for others.</font> That legacy blooms from coast to coast, <font id=44>from sea to shining sea.</font></div>
