<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">A mercury thermometer, at an initial temperature of 20℃, was placed in 30℃ water, and the temperature registered by the thermometer was recorded over time. This procedure was repeated using water samples at 40℃ and 50℃ (see Figure l). Next, the same thermometer, at an initial temperature of 50℃ was placed in an air sample at 20℃, and the temperature registered by the thermometer was recorded over time. This procedure was repeated using air samples at 30℃ and 40℃ (see Figure 2).</div>
