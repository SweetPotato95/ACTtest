<h1>1902: A Space Odyssey</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Our technologically advanced times <font id=31>has allowed</font> filmmakers to create spectacular science fiction films to intrigue us with worlds beyond our experience. Imagine the excitement in <font id=32>1902 when</font> audiences first saw Le Voyage dans la lune (A Trip to the Moon), a groundbreaking movie produced by Georges Méliès.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=35>[1] Undaunted, Méliès honed his photographic skills to tell fantasy stories instead. [2] Méliès, a French magician, was fascinated by the workings of the new motion picture camera. [3] Specializing in stage illusions, he thought the camera offered potential to expand <font id=33>its</font> spectacular magic productions. [4] By 1895, he was working with the new invention. [5] He found <font id=34>out, however,</font>that the public preferred live magic acts to filmed versions.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=36>Méliès's magician's eye led him to discover the basics of special effects.</font> He experimented with effects such as speeding up and slowing down the action, reversing it for backward movement, and superimposing images of fantastic creatures over real people. Using overhead pulleys and trapdoors, <font id=37>he was able to do interesting things.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Aware of the popularity of Jules Verne's science fiction novels, Méliès saw exciting possibilities in filming a space odyssey. The interplanetary travel film that he created, A Trip to the Moon, had production costs of $4,000, <font id=38>highly excessively</font> for its time. In this film, a space capsule <font id=39>that is fired and thereby launched and projected</font> from a cannon lands in the eye of the Man in the Moon. In a strange terrain filled with hostile <font id=40>creatures,</font> the space travelers experience many adventures. They escape back to earth in the capsule by falling off the edge of the <font id=41>moon, landing</font> in the ocean, they bob around until a passing ship finally rescues them.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Producing the film long before interplanetary explorations <font id=42>had began,</font> Méliès could <font id=43>arouse</font> his audience's curiosity with unconstrained fantasy. <font id=44>People are still going to theaters to see science fiction films.</font></div>
