<h1>The Amazing Monarch Migration</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The orange and black monarch <font id=16>butterfly, which</font> is the <font id=17>most easiest</font> recognized and striking butterfly species in North America. Monarchs are particularly fascinating because they are one of the few migratory butterfly species in North America.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=25>[1] In the fall, as daylight and temperatures decrease, migrating monarchs begin their long journey <font id=18>south, an extended flight.</font> [2] Many <font id=19>monarchs, west of the Rocky Mountains</font> migrate to the southern California coast, <font id=20>where</font> they overwinter in eucalyptus groves. [3] <font id=21>Besides,</font> most <font id=22>monarchs</font>, millions of them across the United States and Canada-migrate as many as three thousand miles to Oyamel fir forests near Mexico City. [4] Monarchs have smaller bodies and <font id=23>insufficiently</font> developed nervous systems than migratory birds. [5] The features of birds that help them accomplish their, long migrations are aerodynamic design, acute vision, <font id=24>and the ability to regulate their body temperature and maintain energy.</font> [6] Monarchs lack these features, and yet, in a way that defies explanation, they travel up to eighty miles in a day.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">For decades, scientists have studied this phenomenon, hoping to learn how monarchs are able to fly such distances. Researchers have tagged migrating monarchs to study their flight patterns; and they've hiked to the overwintering <font id=26>sites</font> on the Mexican Plateau, where twenty thousand monarchs are sometimes found clustered on a single Oyamel fir bough.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Scientists' are starting to learn more about the monarch's life cycle. <font id=27>When</font> monarchs that don't migrate to Mexico live only four to six <font id=28>weeks;</font> the migrating generations live at least eight months. After becoming reproductively active in the spring, monarchs that have' migrated begin their return journey. They lay their eggs on milkweed plants along the way and then die. Their offspring hatch, feed on the milkweed, and <font id=29>the migration is eventually continued.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Researchers know they have much to learn, but with the help of new tracking devices and Internet technology that makes data available worldwide, <font id=30>they are .ready to move ahead.</font></div>
