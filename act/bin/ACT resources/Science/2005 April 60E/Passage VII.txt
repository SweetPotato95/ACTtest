Passage VII
The amount of O<sub>2</sub> present in blood and tissues can be measured, in mrn Hg, as the partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> (PO<sub>2</sub>). The percent saturation of Hb is the percent of hemoglobin in the blood that is bound with O<sub>2</sub>. Figure l shows the relationship between percent saturation of Hb and PO<sub>2</sub> at normal body conditions.

Figure 2 shows the relationship between percent saturation of Hb and PO<sub>2</sub> at different pHs. The pH of blood is affected by the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (PCO<sub>2</sub>).

Figure 3 shows the relationship between percent saturation of Hb and PO<sub>2</sub><sub> </sub>at different blood temperatures.

36. According to Figure l, the greatest change in the percent saturation of Hb occurs within which of the following partial pressure ranges ?
F. 0 mm Hg to 10 mm Hg             G. 20 mm Hg to 30 mm Hg
H. 40 mm Hg to 50 mm Hg            J. 60 mm Hg to 70 mm Hg
37. Based on Figures 2 and 3, if blood has a PO<sub>2</sub> of 40 mm Hg, the amount of oxygen bound to Hb would be greatest at which of the following sets of conditions?
A. Temperature = 10℃; pH = 7.6            B. Temperature = 10℃; pH = 7.2
C. Temperature = 43℃; pH = 7.6            D. Temperature = 43℃; pH = 7.2
38. A researcher has clamed that the ability of Hb to bind with O<sub>2</sub> at a given PO<sub>2</sub> will decrease as temperature is increased. Do the data in Figure 3 support his claim?
F. No; as the temperature increased, the percent saturation of Hb increased.
G. No; as the temperature increased, the percent saturation of Hb decreased.
H. Yes; as the temperature increased, the percent saturation of Hb increased.
J. Yes; as the temperature increased, the percent saturation of Hb decreased.
39. Which of. the following tables represents the assumptions about temperature and pH that would have to be made to properly interpret the data in Figures l-3?
A. 
<table>11</table>
B. 
<table>12</table>
C. 
<table>13</table>
D. 
<table>14</table>
40. Based on the data in Figure 2, which of the following statements best explains why PCO<sub>2</sub> affects the pH of blood? When CO<sub>2</sub> dissolves in blood, it:
F. forms an acid.  G. absorbs acids.  H. breaks clown to form O<sub>2</sub>.  J. reacts with O<sub>2</sub> to form Hb.
