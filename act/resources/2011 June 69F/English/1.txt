<h1>Therapy on Horseback</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=3>[1] Most people have heard of physical therapy, in which trained therapists help rehabilitate patients <font id=1>who have</font> a physical difficulty. [2] But not many have heard of hippotherapy. [3] It's a physical therapy treatment strategy for humans that requires the aid of a <font id=2>horse, and it's used for physical therapy. </font> [4] The name comes from the Greek word for horse, hippos. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Hippotherapy has been used in Europe since the 1960s, and more recently in the United States, as a treatment option for people with developmental disorders and neuromuscular problems. <font id=4>4</font> Therapists trained in hippotherapy use horses to help patients improve their physical strength and coordination as well as build patients' self-esteem and confidence.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Why a horse? The movement in a <font id=5>persons' </font> pelvis when he or she rides a horse is similar to the movement created by a person walking upright. <font id=7>This movement is difficult to duplicate using typical physical therapy tools, such as balls and swings, since the possible <font id=6>motions, and functions; </font> of those tools are relatively fixed. </font> Its easy, however <font id=8>a duplication of</font> this pelvic movement with the assistance of a walking horse. <font id=10>A horse-in-motion provides steady sensory input to the patient, <font id=9>and then</font> the walking speed of the horse can be controlled, so can the level of sensory input. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=15> [1] Hippotherapy <font id=11>is not at all like</font> recreational horseback riding. [2] <font id=12>If you were to visit a hippotherapy center, you would see patients in different positions. </font> [3] One purpose of these positions is to allow the patient to learn bow his or her body responds as the horse walks. [4] <font id=13>In other words, </font> trained spotters ensure the patient's safety. [5] Horses are also used because many people are drawn to them [6] Patients often work with the same horse and grow to love that animal. [7] Most of the patients are <font id=14>children, and they</font> enjoy brushing the horses and seeing the horse stables. [8] The experience is a lively and invigorating variation on traditional physical therapy. </font></div>
