<h1>The Great Wall of Los Angeles</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Judith Francisca Baca believes a mural can tell a story and that <font id=45>>a largeness of it</font> gives its creator an amplified voice. <font id=46>It began</font> in the summer of 1976, Baca led the creation of what is likely the longest mural in the world, the Great Wall of Las Angeles.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">This <font id=47>tourist attraction, </font> painted on the concrete wall of the Tujunga Wash, a flood-control channel in the San Fernando Valley, <font id=48>is over thirteen feet high</font> and almost a half mile long. The project was commissioned by Los Angeles city officials, <font id=49>those</font> wanted well-known local muralist Baca to beautify the channel area. She took this opportunity to bring the people of multiethnic Los Angeles together to produce a narrative mural of their stories.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Baca imagined the <font id=50>mural, on the channel wall</font> as a timeline. It would proclaim the historical experiences of California's <font id=51>people's, </font> focusing mainly on the experiences of women, the poor, and minorities. She <font id=52>wants</font> as many people as possible, especially young people, to help create the mural.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=53>53</font> For guidance, they interviewed hundreds of city residents, historians, and social activists. The subjects they <font id=54>picked ranged from: </font> Dust Bowl refugees to civil rights <font id=55>activists, </font> Olympic champions to labor organizers, land disputes to the growth of suburbia.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Next, area artists drew <font id=56>miniature</font> sketches of the scenes on <font id=57>grids. After that, they</font> created a blueprint of the mural including "bridge images" that wave <font id=58>them</font> together. A huge grid was traced onto a smoothed and sealed section of the channel wall, and the blueprint sketches were outlined onto it. <font id=59>The drawings were then painted, over numerous summers, by Los Angeles teens in groups recruited with the help of outreach organizations. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In 1983, the mural was finally finished Dozens of professional artists, over four hundred teens, and thousands of other community members had contributed to the Great Wall of Los Angeles, <font id=60>a celebration of the many voices of the city. </font></div>
