<h1>At Home in a Language</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">When I was a child growing up in Delhi, <font id=30>India My</font> parents and I <font id=31>will have spent</font> our summers in Calcutta, India, visiting my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. We took the train over eight hundred miles from Delhi to Calcutta, which I considered a treat <font id=32> as</font> itself. I loved the dining car, the cozy sleeping berth in our cabin, <font id=33>and</font> the gentle rocking motion of the train that would <font id=34>lull</font> me to sleep at night. <font id=35>As an adult, I prefer to travel by car. </font> When we arrived at the Calcutta station the next morning, we were welcomed announcing train arrivals and departures over the intercom <font id=36>by the sound of the Bengali language. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Back in Delhi, the language most people commonly spoke was Hindi. Though I spoke Hindi fluently, it wasn't my first language. My parents were born in Calcutta, where most people spoke Bengali. They had lived there for years before they got married and moved to <font id=37>Delhi, where Hindi was widely spoken. </font> Because my parents had grown up speaking Bengali, we spoke Bengali, not Hindi, in our house. It was not surprising, then, that hearing Bengali on the streets of Calcutta made me feel right at home.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Being in Calcutta was a comfort to me because <font id=38>I could speak</font> almost exclusively in my first language. Store clerks, cab drivers, bus drivers, schoolchildren, families picnicking in the parks: it seemed like everybody in Calcutta spoke Bengali. It only took me a day or two to adjust to not having to manage two languages. Communicating with such ease was a <font id=39>relief; </font> in Delhi I felt split in half, but in Calcutta I <font id=40>really felt like two people. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">I also <font id=41>found life in my grandparents' house</font> easy to get used to. Their house was always <font id=42>overflowing with</font> members of my father's family. Being an only child, I <font id=43> savored</font> this time spent with relatives. My aunts and uncles loved to tease me and tell me jokes and stories. I would skip through the rooms of my grandparents' sprawling house with my cousins, <font id=44>thrilled to have all that extra space in which to play games and have fun. </font></div>
