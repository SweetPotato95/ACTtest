<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">When we were children, my older brother and I spent many afternoons coloring at the kitchen table. <font id=61>61</font> I would hold up a carnation pink or a line green crayon, <font id=62>cover the worn label with my thumb, and asking</font> my brother what color I was holding. I was always <font id=63>surprised</font> time after time, he could not tell the difference between a pink crayon and a green one. The reason for this was that he is color-blind.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[2]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=65> [1] This is rarely the case. [2] "Color-blind" is a bit of a misnomer, as it implies that people with color blindness cannot see any colors. [3] The human eye contains rod cells, which allow us to see black and white and perceive gradations of lightness, and cone cells, which allow us to see color. [4] Almost all instances of color blindness involve only the <font id=64>eye's reception</font> of red and green. [5] Most people with color blindness cannot differentiate between red and green, but others just see these colors differently than people without color blindness. </font></div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[3]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Seven percent of American males are color-blind, while only 0.4 percent of American females <font id=66>are. </font> This <font id=67>conversion</font> supports the idea that the gene far color blindness is carried on the X <font id=68>chromosome, </font> men have only one X chromosome (in addition to one Y chromosome). [A] Women have two X chromosomes, <font id=69>so</font> a deficiency in <font id=70>it</font> can be compensated for by the other.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[4]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">My brother can easily distinguish pure reds from pure greens <font id=71>without any difficulty. </font> [B] However, the farther these colors are from "pure" (such as carnation pink or lime green), the more difficult it is for him to tell the difference.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[5]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">It has been years since I bothered my brother with a crayon-color guessing game, but I am still intrigued by how he perceives color. [C] He <font id=72>has became</font> a successful <font id=73>painter specializing in, landscapes of exotic places</font> rendered in vivid colors. [D] He swirls bright color over canvas, transforming pats of apple red, lemon yellow, and robin's egg blue paint into dazzling and vibrant bills, beaches, and mountains, <font id=74>like visions out of fantastic dreams. </font></div>
