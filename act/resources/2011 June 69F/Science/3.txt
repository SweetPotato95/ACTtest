<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">As calcium oxalate hydrate (<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\171.png' width = '159'height = '42'/>) is heated, it first dehydrates to yield calcium oxalate (<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\172.png' width = '94'height = '42'/>). Next, the <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\173.png' width = '94'height = '42'/> decomposes into calcium carbonate (<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\174.png' width = '84'height = '42'/>) and carbon monoxide (CO). The <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\175.png' width = '84'height = '42'/> then further decomposes into CaO and <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\176.png' width = '55'height = '42'/> (see equations below).</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the mass of a sample is monitored as the sample's temperature is steadily increased. A noureactive gas is streamed over the sample to carry away any gaseous products. The figure shows the results of a TGA of a 100 g sample of<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\180.png' width = '159'height = '42'/>.</div>
