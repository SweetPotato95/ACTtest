<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Scientists once thought that on Earth the methane (<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\153.png' width = '56'height = '42'/>) from natural sources was produced only by methanogens (bacteria that cannot survive in the presence of<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\154.png' width = '36'height = '42'/>). It has been recently discovered that some plants emit CH<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\155.png' width = '16'height = '42'/> that is generated by an unknown process operating under aerobic conditions (<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\156.png' width = '36'height = '42'/>present). Three studies examined <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\157.png' width = '56'height = '42'/> emission by plants.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Study 1</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Beech tree leaves were collected, air-dried, and sterilized. A small quantity (1-6 g) of the air-dried, sterilized leaves was placed in each of 20 identical glass tubes. Each tube was then capped. Using a needle inserted through the cap, the air in each tube was replaced with <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\158.png' width = '56'height = '42'/>-free air. The tubes were then separated into 5 groups of 4 tubes each. Each group of tubes was incubated in the dark for 16 hr at 30℃, 40℃, 50℃, 60℃, or 70℃. The average <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\159.png' width = '56'height = '42'/> emission rate was determined for each group at the end of the incubation period. This procedure was repeated using ash tree leaves (see Figure 1).</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The procedure of Study 1 was repeated except that air-dried, unsterilized beech and ash leaves were tested (see Figure 2).</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Several sweetgrass plants were placed in a large Plexiglas chamber. This chamber and an identical chamber with no sweetgrass inside were then sealed. Using a pump, air in each chamber was replaced with <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\162.png' width = '55'height = '38'/>-free air, after which the chambers were incubated in the dark at 30℃. At 102 min after incubation began, the chambers were placed in direct sunlight for a short period, then returned to the dark to continue incubation at 30℃. Beginning when the chambers were first placed in the dark, the <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 June 69F\imgs\163.png' width = '55'height = '38'/> concentration in the air inside the chambers was measured every 25 or 50 min for 250 min (see Figure 3).</div>
