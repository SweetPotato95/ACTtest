Fecal coliforms are bacteria found in the intestines of all endothermic animals. Two studies in 2001 examined fecal coliform concentrations in surface water samples from a large freshwater lake and its tributary streams.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Study 1</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Around 10 A.M. on Monday of every week in June, July, and August, 100 mL water samples were collected from 3 separate locations within the area of the lake designated for swimming. The samples were analyzed to determine. the average fecal coliform concentration, in colony-forming units (CFU) per 100 mL (see Figure 1). A CFU value is the number of distinct colonies formed on a growth plate by the bacteria in a sample after the sample has been placed on the growth plate and incubated for 24 hr.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Study 2</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In July, on the last of 14 consecutive days of fair weather, 100 mL water samples were collected from each of the following sites—the designated swimming area, 6 lake sites that were outside the designated swimming area, and each of the lake's 5 tributary streams. Several 100 g samples of sand from the beach at the designated swimming area were also collected. A second set of samples was collected at the same sites on a rainy July day, the last of 7 consecutive days of rain. The samples were analyzed to determine the average fecal coliform concentration (see Figure 2). The heavy, dashed, horizontal line in Figure 2 represents the fecal coliform water quality standard for the lake. If the average fecal coliform concentration for water samples collected from the lake on a particular day exceeds this level, all swimming in the lake is prohibited for that day.</div>
