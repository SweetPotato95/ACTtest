<h1>The Joys of Walking</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">While some people are exhilarated by vigorous exercise, I am not. I love feeling fit, but I hate working out. <font id=1>I've tried dozens of different fitness activities, but all of them leave me bored, sore, or frustrated by my inability to do them well and how boring they were. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Finally, I made a deal with myself. Each day I would try to find time for a half-hour <font id=2>walk. Fitting</font> it into my schedule whenever I could. Running <font id=3>errands and</font> visiting friends <font id=4>if I walked</font> would take longer to my destination, but I consoled myself with virtuous thoughts of how my body could benefit from the effort.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=5>A funny thing happen ed on my way to fitness. </font> While I usually felt physically invigorated by my walks, even more satisfying were the psychological rewards. Walking cleared my head and brightened my spirits in a way no other exercise routine ever had.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=10> [1] Walking slowed my often frenetic pace. [2] I <font id=6>was trying to go too fast. </font> [3] In spring, I'd rejoice in the first crocuses emerging <font id=7>out</font> the snow, the faint misting of green on tree branches just beginning to bud, the colorful explosion of. tulips and daffodils. [4] I anticipated crisp fall days <font id=8>and the crackle of leaves in my path. </font> [5] As the lushness of summer gradually unfolded, I noticed for what seemed like the first time the homey smell of freshly mown grass and the warmth of sunlight on my face. [6] Even in bitter winter, I treasured my walking time, and after a stressful day <font id=9>a stroll to decompress myself was often craved, I found. </font></font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">I've thought many times of the <font id=11>instinctive</font> way our bodies respond to the beat of music by wanting to get up and dance, <font id=12>or how</font> a parent quiets a crying baby by walking back and forth. I think that at some deep level we humans need <font id=13>steady rhythmic, </font> movement to feel centered and content.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">So now when I want to escape the busyness of my life, I take a walk. No matter how far I go, I know that I will return <font id=14>refreshed in</font> both body and mind.</div>
