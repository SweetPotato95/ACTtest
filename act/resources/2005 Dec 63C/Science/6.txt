<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">A student performed 4 computer simulation studies to model the change at a gene in a population. For each study, the following rules applied:</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The gene has 2 alleles (possible forms): A and a.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Each organism has 2 copies of the gene.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Thus, there ate 3 possible genotypes (allele combinations for the gene): AA, Aa, and aa.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Different genotypes may have different fitnesses (the relative number of alleles per individual a genotype contributes to the next generation).</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The fitnesses of Genotypes AA, Aa, and aa are represented by W(AA), W(Aa), and W(aa), respectively.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">p = the proportion of the alleles that are in Form A.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Changes in p are due to differences in the fitnesses of the genotypes.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Time is measured in generations.</div>
