Passage IV
Compost consists largely of organic matter that has been decomposed by bacterial that require oxygen. Compost is used as soil fertilizer. Two studies were done to examine the effect of compost use on the growth and yield of bean plants.
Study 1
Four different materials were selected for composting-coffee grounds, pine needles, crushed eggshells, and alfalfa (a plant). Each material was placed in a separate container. A small amount of distilled water was. Added to each material. The 4 containers were then left in a warm location for about a week to allow the materials to decompose. During the week, the materials were stirred periodically and moistened with distilled water. The decomposition process was considered complete when the temperature at the center of the material had risen to 40â„ƒ. For each type of compost; the pH, and the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents were then determined (see Table l).

Study 2
Each type of compost was added to 2 different amounts of a given soil to create mixtures that were either 20% compost or 50% compost. A ninth mixture contained 10% pine needles, 50% crushed eggshells, 20% alfalfa, and 20% soil. Each mixture was used to fill 5 pots. Ten bean seeds were planted in each pot. All pots received the same amount of light and distilled water. After 6 weeks, the number of mature bean plants growing in the pots and the number of bean pods on each plant were counted for each mixture. The percent of seeds that produced mature bean plants for each mixture is shown in Table 2. Figure 1 shows, for those plants that produced bean pods, the acerage number of bean pods present on mature bean plants growing in each mixture.

18. To determine .whether adding compost to soil increases the percent of seeds that produce mature bean plants, the researchers should have included pots in Study 2 that contained:
F. pine needles only.       G. soil only.     H. 30% crushed eggshells and 70% soil
J. 70% alfalfa and 30% soil.
19. It was hypothesized that the compost with the highest percent nitrogen, when added to soil, would produce mature bean plants from at least 75% of the planted bean seeds. Is this hypothesis supported by the results of Study l and Study 2?
A. Yes; alfalfa had the highest percent nitrogen, and both alfalfa mixtures produced mature bean plants from at least 75% of the planted seeds.
B. Yes; coffee grounds had the highest percent nitrogen, and both coffee-grounds mixtures produced mature bean plants from at least 75% of the planted seeds.
C. No; alfalfa had the highest percent nitrogen, but neither alfalfa mixture pr06uce.d mature bean plants from at least 75% of the plaiited seeds.
D. No; coffee grounds had the highest percent nitrogen, but neither coffee-grounds mixture produced mature bean plants from at least 75% of the planted seeds.
20. Based on. the description of Study l, as organic matter decomposes, which of the following changes takes place?
F. The phosphorus content of the material being composted decreases.
G. The phosphorus content of the material being composted increases.
H. The temperature of the material being composted decreases.
J. The temperature of the material being composted increases.
21. The primary purpose of stirring the materials in Study 1 was to:
A. lower the pH of. the materials.          B. raise the pH of the materials.
C. decrease the amount of oxygen in the materials.
D. increase the amount of oxygen in the materials.
22. It is known that bean plants must receive some potassium from the surrounding material in order to grow to maturity. Based on the results of Study l, in Study 2, the mature bean plants in mixtures containing pine needles most likely obtained the required potassium from:
F. the pine needles only.     G. the soil only.
H. both the pine needles and the soil.       J. the added distilled water.
