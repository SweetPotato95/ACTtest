Passage III
A solid cylinder is mounted on frictionless bearings. A thin string of negligible mass is wrapped around the cylinder and pulled with a constant force, as shown in Figure l.

The force results in a torque, τ, on the cylinder that causes the cylinder to spin. The angular acceleration, α of the cylinder is the change of the cylinder’s rotational speed over time.
Tables l, 2, and 3 give τ and a for various cylinder masses, cylinder radii, and forces, respectively Table 4 shows the rotational speed of a particular cylinder at different times.
(Note: A11 0f the cylinders described in Tables l-4 have the same length.)

12. Was the cylinder described in Table 4 accelerating (speeding up) or decelerating (slowing down) between 1.0 and 4.0 sec?
F. Accelerating, because the rotation al speed was decreasing.
G. Accelerating, because the rotational speed was increasing.
H. Decelerating, because the rotational speed was decreasing.
J. Decelerating, because the rotational speed was increasing.
13. Based on Table l, how is the torque τ related to the force pulling the string and the radius of the cylinder?
A. Torque equals radius plus force.       B. Torque equals radius minus force.
C. Torque equals radius times force.       D. Torque equals radius divided by force.
14. Based-on Table l, if a 2.0N force were exerted upon a 5.0kg cylinder with a radius of 0.050m, α would be;
F. less than 10 rad/sec2. .                      G. between 10 rad/sec2 and 13 rad/sec2.
H. between 13 rad/sec2 and 20 rad/sec2.          J. greater than 20 rad/sec2.
15. Suppose we define the frequency of rotation of the cylinder as the number of rotations the cylinder completes in a second. Based on Table 2, 1 second after starting from rest, the cylinder having the highest frequency of rotation will be the one with a radius of:
A. 0.050 m.      B. 0.075 m.         C. 0.100 m.        D. 0.125 m.
16. Based on Table 4, rotational speed is proportional to:
F. time.        G. time2.       H. time3.         J. time4.
