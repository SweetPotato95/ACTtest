Passage VI
A student performed 4 computer simulation studies to model the change at a gene in a population. For each study, the following rules applied:
The gene has 2 alleles (possible forms): A and a.
Each organism has 2 copies of the gene.
Thus, there ate 3 possible genotypes (allele combinations for the gene): AA, Aa, and aa.
Different genotypes may have different fitnesses (the relative number of alleles per individual a genotype contributes to the next generation).
The fitnesses of Genotypes AA, Aa, and aa are represented by W(AA), W(Aa), and W(aa), respectively.
p = the proportion of the alleles that are in Form A.
Changes in p are due to differences in the fitnesses of the genotypes.
Time is measured in generations.
Study l
Three simulations were done. In each, W(AA) = W(Aa)>W(aa), and the initial p = 0.1. See Figure l.

Study 2
Three simulations were done. In each, W(AA) = W(Aa)< W(aa), and the initial p = 0.9. See Figure 2.

Study 3
Five simulations were performed. In each, W(AA) = 0.8; W(Aa) = 1.0; and W(aa) = 0.6. The initial p varied. See Figure 3.

Study 4  .
Five simulations were performed. In each, W(AA) = 0.625; W(Aa) = 0.5; and W(aa) = 1.0. The initial p varied. See Figure 4.

28. In Study 4, the initial values of p were:
F. 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and l.0.         G. 0.4, 0.45, 0.5; 0.95, and l.0.
H. 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, and 0.9.        J. 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, and l.0.
29. For the simulation in Study 1 in which W(aa) = 0.4, the greatest change in p occurred during which of the following time frames?
A. Between Generation 0 and Generation 10     B. Between Generation 10 and Generation 20
C. Between Generation 20 and Generation 30    D. Between Generation 30 and Generation 40
30. Based on the information provided, which of the following shows the possible range for p?
F. 0-0.5    G. 0-1.0     H. 0.5-1.0     J. 0.5-2.0
31. In all 3 simulations in Study l, W(Aa) equaled:
A. 0.8.     B. 1.0.      C. 1.2.      D. 2.0.
32. Which studies included at least l simulation in which the fitness of Genotype AA was greater than the fitness of Genotype aa?
F. Studies l and 3       G. Studies l and 4       H. Studies 2 and 3        J. Studies 2 and 4
33. If the student wanted to run an additional simulation in Study l in which the initial p = 0.1 and p at Generation 10 was between 0.7 and 0.8, the student should set W(AA) = 1.0; W(Aa) = 1.0; and:
A. W(aa)=0.3.       B. W(aa)=0.5.       C. W(aa)=0.7.        D. W(aa)=0.9.
