Passage II
How big a star looks at a given distance defines the star’s angular size, θ (see Figure l).
Table 1 gives θ of the Sun if it were observed from various distance. Table 2 gives θ of stars 8 light years away from Earth that have various diameter.
For a star to be seen as a disk through a telescope, the telescope’s resolution, R, must be less than or equal to θ of the star. Table 3 shows R using yellow light for telescopes of various diameters. Table 4 gives R for a 10m (diameter) telescope using light of different colors.

7. Based on Table 4, which of. the following graphs best illustrates the relationship between R and the wave-length of light?

8. According to Table 3, at. a given wavelength, as the diameter of a telescope increases, the smallest angular size that an object can have and still be seen as a disk through the telescope:
F. increases only.  G. decreases only.  H. remains constant.  J. varies, but with no general trend.
9. The Sun’s diameter is l.4×106 km. How does the Sun’s diameter compare with the diameters of the 4 stars listed in Table 2? The Sun’s diameter is:
A. greater than the diameters of all 4 stars.      B. less than the diameters of all 4 stars.
C. the same as the diameter of the 4 stars.
D. greater than the diameters of 2 0f the stars and less than the diameters of the other 2 stars.
10. Table l gives the angular size of the Sun if it were observed from a distance of 8 light years. How would I this angular size compare with the angular sizes of the 4 stars listed in Table 2? The Sun’s angular size would be:
F. greater than the angular sizes of all 4 stars.     G. less than the angular sizes of all 4 stars.
H. greater than the angular size of l of the stars arid less than the angular sizes of 3 of the stars.
J. the same as the angular size of the 4 stars.
11. A hypothetical yellow star at a given distance from Earth has a θ of 2.0×10-2 arcsecond. Based on information in the passage, the star will be seen as a disk through Earth-based telescopes having which of the diameters listed in Table 3?
A. 2m only.       B. 2m, 4m, and 6m only.         C. 8m and 10m only.
D. Any of the diameters listed in Table 3
