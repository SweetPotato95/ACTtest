<h1>Stars in His Eyes</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Some people are starstruck at an early <font id=16>age, but one</font> such person is Neil de Grasse Tyson, <font id=17> whom</font> turned his fascination for the star-studded sky into a career. By the age of nine, <font id=18>with the knowledge</font> that he wanted to spend his life exploring the universe. Today, Tyson is a prominent astrophysicist, writer, and educator. He is also the youngest person and the first African American, to direct New York City's Hay den Planetarium.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In his memoir, The Sky Is Not the Limit, Tyson tells the story of how he was first captivated by the cosmos. A close friend from his Bronx, New York, neighborhood took him to the rooftop of a <font id=19>building, there Tyson was told</font> to look up into the night sky. Through a simple pair of binoculars, Tyson viewed the Moon as an exciting new three-dimensional <font id=20>world that astounded him.</font> From that <font id=21>point on</font>, his interest in becoming a scientist was set.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=26> [1] In junior high, Tyson bought <font id=22>his first telescope</font> with money he had earned walking his neighbors' dogs. [2] To further prepare for his future career, he <font id=23>joined astronomy clubs, took extra mathematics courses</font>, and spent many hours looking up at the star-filled dome inside the planetarium that he now oversees. [3] While earning university degrees in both physics and astrophysics, he worked as a columnist for StarDate, an astronomy magazine. [4] In 1988, he published the first of his numerous books on astronomy and astrophysics. [5] Soon after he was appointed director of the Hay den Planetarium in 1996, Tyson spearheaded a seventy-million-dollar reconstruction project. [6] Under his leadership, the New York City landmark was <font id=24>transformed, one at a time,</font> into a high-tech glass-and-steel wonder. [7] Visitors to the planetarium's Space Theater can now view the marvels of the cosmos through <font id=25>a dramatic</font> virtual tour. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Tyson <font id=27>recognizes</font> the possibilities of his <font id=28>position he</font> always makes himself available to children who visit the planetarium. Committed to being a leader in the field of science education, he <font id=29>has achieved what for many would be a dream come true</font>.</div>
