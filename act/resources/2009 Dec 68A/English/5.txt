<h1>Innovation and Prior Discoveries</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The <font id=61>philosopher, John Stuart Mill</font> wrote that "all good things which exist are the fruits of originality." <font id=62>However, </font> Mill probably also understood that <font id=63>the fact is that</font> no human invention is absolutely original. Every innovation—whether scientific or artistic—is influenced by prior discoveries.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Albert Einstein is often considered the most original scientist of the modern age. <font id=64>Therefore, he </font>acknowledged his reliance on the work of others, such as mathematician Emmy Noether—who herself relied on prior discoveries. The mathematical theorem that now bears her last name <font id=65>65</font> helped <font id=66>lie the foundation for</font> quantum physics and allowed Einstein to formulate his theory of general relativity.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In literature, author Gertrude Stein epitomized originality. Her writing initially shocked readers because it departed from conventional grammar, storytelling, and style. Stein separated words from their fixed meanings. She used words not as representations of reality but as pure forms, <font id=67>as if</font> they were musical notes. Yet, as innovative as she was, <font id=68>borrowed</font> from the world of visual art, <font id=69>particularly</font> from the Cubist painters. Stein <font id=70>remarked, that</font> she was doing in writing what Pablo Picasso was doing in painting.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">It's often difficult to trace an innovation <font id=71>as</font> a single origin. Modern peanut butter, with its smooth, creamy texture and long shelf life, emerged <font id=72>in 1922</font> when Joseph L. Rosefield began selling his peanut butters in California. However, George A. Bayle, Jr., sold a peanut paste as early as 1890, and <font id=73>others</font> are known to have used ground or crushed peanuts centuries earlier.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Although Mill praised originality, his own work drew on <font id=74>that, of fellow utilitarian philosopher</font> Jeremy Bentham. Mill and Bentham both advocated striving for the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Mill, however, <font id=75>will argue that</font> people should seek the highest quality—not only quantity—of pleasure. Mill, then, made an important contribution to philosophy—regardless of how original his ideas were.</div>
