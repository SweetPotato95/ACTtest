<h1>The Tale of The Tale of Genji</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Murasaki <font id=1>Shikibu, an aristocratic Japanese woman</font> was born in Kyoto, Japan, around AD 973. Like most ladies of that period <font id=2>who served</font> in the court of the empress, Lady Murasaki was likely accomplished in both music, and writing. However, her writing was not limited to the traditional poetry 3 <font id=3>was expected</font> of cultured women of that time. She wrote a long work of fiction, The Tale of Genji, which not only is still read today <font id=4>and</font> has been called the world's first great novel.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=5>Although little</font> is known of the events of her life, but scholars speculate that Lady Murasaki began writing her fiction before she came into the service of the Empress Akiko. Since the "grand ladies" of the court thought literature important, perhaps Murasaki's writing was the reason she was summoned to court. <font id=6>Instead,</font> she completed most of the stories of the life of Genji while both serving the empress and <font id=7>observed</font> the activities and attitudes of court society.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The fifty-four-chapter book, <font id=8>which takes place over almost three-quarters of a century, </font> describes the life and "loves of a Prince Genji and the lives of <font id=9>there</font> children and grandchildren. Although other fiction was written during this period, Murasaki's work went beyond the usual style. Instead of using the flat characterizations and fairy-tale predicaments of the typical romance, Murasaki portrayed believable people in daily situations. Recent critics have been astonished at the modern character of the tale.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In the more than one <font id=10>thousand years since</font> The Tale of Genji was written, it has been translated into over thirty languages and has appeared in a variety of formats. In the twelfth century, the tale was illustrated with picture scrolls; in the seventeenth <font id=11>century, books of wood-block prints</font> based on the tale <font id=12>was</font> produced.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=13>13</font> Today, Lady Murasaki's eleventh-century tale can even be read online at a Web site provided by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. <font id=14>14</font></div>
