<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Creativity can be defined by some as the act of turning new and imaginative ideas into reality. It is characterized by the ability to perceive the world in new ways, to find hidden patterns, to make connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena, and to generate solutions. However, the practicality and usefulness of all things described as creative is certainly debatable in today’s world that is filled with an endless stream of newly created information. Do individuals need to be creative and is it important for living well? Should young people today be encouraged to learn creativity?</div>
