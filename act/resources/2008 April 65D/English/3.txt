<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The following paragraphs may or may not be in the most logical order. Each paragraph is numbered in brackets, and question 45 will ask you to choose where Paragraph 3 should most logically be placed.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[1] Historians speculate that one of the world's oldest toys is the <font id=31>yo-yo, though they know for-sure that the oldest toy- is the doll.</font> Drawings, <font id=32>of objects</font> adorn ancient Greek vases and the walls of Egyptian temples, <font id=33>if</font> written mention of yo-yos goes back to the fifth century B.C.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[2] While many cultures had their variations of the yo-yo, the American version can be traced to the Philippines, where yo-yos <font id=34>have been a national pastime for centuries.</font> In fact, the name yo-yo is a Tagalog word that translates <font id=35>as</font> "come back." In the 1920s Pedro Flores, a Filipino immigrant, introduced the toy in the United <font id=36>States and</font> soon started a yo-yo manufacturing company in California. Flores's design was different because the yo-yo's string wasn't tied to the axle of the toy, but rather looped around it. This allowed a skilled handler to make the toy spin at the end of its string, or "sleep."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[3] Yo-yo technology <font id=37>really progressed substantially by making</font> a leap forward in the 1970s when designers added weighted rims so the toy would spin for a longer time. In 1980, another innovation led to the development of the "yo-yo with a brain," which featured a spring-loaded mechanism that caused the yo-yo to return to its owner's hand.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[4] The American craze for the toy <font id=38>began</font>, when the entrepreneur Donald Duncan saw a demonstration of Flores's new yo-yo. Noticing the large crowd <font id=39>who</font> watched, Duncan quickly realized the yo-yo's potential. Flores sold his yo-yo company and all rights to Duncan in <font id=40>1932, after deciding</font> that he was more interested in teaching people how to handle yo-yos than he was in manufacturing them. Duncan immediately launched an elaborate national advertising campaign to promote the toy. <font id=42>He also sent Duncan Yo-Yo Professionals around the country, <font id=41>demonstrating</font> tricks and sponsoring contests. </font> Millions of the toys were sold.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[5] In 1985, this most ancient of <font id=43>toys, went</font> into space; Astronauts aboard the space <font id=44> shuttle Discovery</font> demonstrated that while a yo-yo would spin in a near-zero ' gravity environment, it refused to sleep.</div>
