<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">A flask filled with, distilled water was slowly heated. As the temperature of the water increased, the height of the water in the tubing increased. At 100°C, water and steam squirted out the top of the tubing.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The body of flask filled with distilled water was submerged in a cold bath at -6°C. As the temperature of the water in the apparatus decreased, the height of the. water in the-tubing decreased. At 4°C, the height of the water in the tubing stopped decreasing, and then began to increase. At 0°C, water and ice were forced out the top of the tubing. Eventually, the flask cracked in several places.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Two saltwater solutions were prepared. Solution I had a lower salt concentration (in g/mL) than did Solution II. Two flasks containing Solutions I and II, respectively, were slowly heated.

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Two flasks containing Solutions I and II, respectively, were cooled as in Experiment 2. In both flasks, the height of the salt water in the tubing decreased until the temperature reached -6°C and then remained level (no freezing occurred).</div>
