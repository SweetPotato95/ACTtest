<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Volcanoes put sulfur into the troposphere and the stratosphere, where the sulfur reacts to form sulfate aerosols (liquid droplets suspended in air). For locations at 50°N latitude, aerosols present at altitudes below 11 km scatter incoming solar energy, resulting in cooler air, while aerosols present at higher altitudes absorb incoming solar energy, warming the air.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Figure 1 shows the air temperature deviation at the surface of, and at 2 different altitudes above, a particular volcano (located at 50°N latitude), before and after it erupted. Figure 2 shows the maximum surface air temperature deviation associated with the specific mass of sulfate aerosols formed in the stratosphere after each of 8 volcanoes erupted.</div>
