<h1>An Evening Walk in Washington</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">During the day, Washington, D.C., bustles with visitors, but even after sundown many people gather at <font id=46>they're</font> famous buildings and monuments. I'd heard that the city's attractions appear even more impressive after dark, <font id=47>not only the historic monuments but also the excellent museums. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Beams of light <font id=48>enlightened</font> the exterior of the White House, <font id=49>and</font> every window glowed as the work of governing continued into the night. Tourists peered through the fence, pointing when they saw a figure passing by one of the windows. Could that be the president?</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Families from all over the world—<font id=50>speaking</font> in a wonderful variety of languages and dialects—posed for photographs with the brightly lit White House as the backdrop.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">A few blocks away, in the National Mall, I climbed the long flight of marble stairs to the portico of the Lincoln Memorial, <font id=51>located here even though Abraham Lincoln is buried in Illinois. </font> <font id=52>The statue appeared to gaze down on the Reflecting Pool, where a little girl watched as her father twirled a flashlight to make its beam dance across the still water. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[1] Across from the Lincoln Memorial, I joined a group of visitors <font id=53>heading toward</font> the Korean War Veterans Memorial. [2] Spotlights near the <font id=54>soldiers' feet, </font> lit up the men's faces, showing expressions of fatigue, concern, and determination. [3] The surrounding darkness enhanced the drama of the scene. <font id=55>[4] The memorial featured nineteen statues of soldiers arranged in a triangular formation. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=56>Nearby, light reflected off the polished surface of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial's black granite wall.</font> Etched with the names of fallen soldiers, <font id=57>visitors had adorned the wall with flowers and American flags left</font> in remembrance.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=58>Indeed, </font> evening <font id=59>proved as</font> an excellent time to visit the White House and the Mall. <font id=60>Many of the city's most important historic sites are located in this area.</font> What remained visible were the buildings and monuments that represented some of the most significant events of this nation.</div>
