<h1>Edmonia Lewis and Her Marble Cleopatra</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In 1988, during a routine inspection of a salvage yard in the Chicago area, firefighter Harold Adams made a discovery that helped solve a 100-year-old mystery. Amid the debris, he came face to face with a monumental statue of a queen <font id=16>in the salvage yard.</font> The work of art had such a commanding presence that he felt compelled to bring it to the attention of <font id=17>people who might be able to identify, repair, and permanently protect it.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Eventually, the <font id=18>statues identity</font> emerged. The woman depicted was none other than the Egyptian ruler Cleopatra. The <font id=19>artist was</font> Edmonia Lewis, born in 1840 to an Ojibway mother and African American father. As a young person, Lewis had studied at Oberlin College before moving to Boston and later Rome, where she joined a community of American sculptors living abroad. <font id=20>Carving Italian marble by hand,</font> Lewis portrayed <font id=21>Cleopatra taking, her last</font> breath. <font id=22>The Death of Cleopatra was hailed by many critics as the most impressive' sculpture' at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, the event for which it had been-created. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Shortly after the exposition, the statue fell into mysterious circumstances that frustrated the art lovers who tried over the years <font id=23>to</font> locate it.Decades passed before the story of <font id=24>it's</font> journey <font id=25>were</font> pieced together. For a while, the marble <font id=26>queen had resided</font> in a Chicago saloon. Later, it marked the grave of a racehorse named Cleopatra. By the time Adams stumbled upon the two-ton statue, it was chipped, cracked, and covered with graffiti. Until it could be <font id=27>shipped</font> to restoration experts, Lewis's masterpiece was stored—alongside paper turkeys, tinsel streamers, and half-empty cans of paint—in a back room <font id=28>somewhere. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The death of Cleopatra returned to the limelight in the 1990s when, after being meticulously restored, the sculpture went on display at the National Museum of American Art in Washington, D.C. <font id=29>Where</font> it continues to inspire renewed <font id=30>appreciation all over again</font> for a bold and gifted American artist, Edmonia Lewis.</div>
