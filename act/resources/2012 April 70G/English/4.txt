<h1>Wild West, White Linens</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In the late 1800s, <font id=46>people who traveled</font> west of the Mississippi River by train meant heading into a region still rough around the edges: The terrain was rugged. The weather was harsh. <font id=47>Rigid were the train's seats. </font> Food was scarce.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=48>Then suddenly one day, </font> "eating houses" appeared anywhere trains took a twenty-minute stop to replenish <font id=49>an engines' water supply. </font> These eateries were often <font id=50>a little more then</font> ramshackle sheds or hastily erected tents. The use of campfire cooking and a lack of refrigeration meant passengers were likely to be served a concoction of spoiled produce and half-cooked meat impersonating stew.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=51>In 1901, Fred Harvey's sons took over the company. </font> Out of Harvey's talent and ambition <font id=52>to grow</font> the Harvey. House chain of restaurants. Harvey struck a deal with a major railroad line, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. In return for Santa Fe trains delivering fresh produce, meat, and dairy products to his kitchens daily, Harvey promised not to open any restaurants along competitors' routes. <font id=53>Which resulted in that only</font> the Santa Fe railroad would offer passengers hot, savory meals served in elegant style.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=59> [1] Instead of food-stained planks, Harvey House tables were draped in white linen. [2] Tin plates were replaced by fine china and silverware. [3] A cadre of young <font id=54>women-dubbed "the Harvey Girls" </font> served guests quickly and cordially. [4] Harvey believed the term "waitress" implied <font id=55>servitude not</font> his staff would offer gracious hospitality. [5] And incredible food. [6] Rather than suffering days-old stew, customers at Harvey House were served meals such as <font id=56>meat, vegetables, and dessert, </font> all for about seventy-five cents. [7] In fact, the first known use of the expression "blue plate special," indicating <font id=57>a bargain-cost, </font> complete, inexpensive meal <font id=58> (served on an actual blue plate), </font> was on an 1892 Harvey House menu. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Today, only a few Harvey Houses remain. Still, whenever a roadside diner advertises a blue plate special-irrespective of the actual color of the plate-<font id=60>its</font> invoking Harvey's dining philosophy: good food at a reasonable price.</div>
