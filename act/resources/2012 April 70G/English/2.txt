<h1>Polaris: Not Always the North Star</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Polaris, the star now almost directly over the North Pole, has played <font id=16>a significant</font> role in many mythologies and in the history of navigation. For centuries, sailors and leaders of desert caravans used the North Star to chart their courses. <font id=17>Polaris has been called the Lodestar, the Steering Star, and Stella Maris (the Star of the Sea). </font> <font id=18>Finally, people</font> in ancient India believed it was the Golden Peg that held the universe together. <font id=19>In Scandinavian mythology, Polaris was thought to be the jeweled head of the World Spike-an enormous nail the Norse gods had hammered into the sky so the stars could revolve around it. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=23>[1] However, as the Greek astronomer Hipparchus discovered around 129 BC, the North Star, or polestar is not eternally fixed over the North Pole, as the mythmakers had supposed. [2] In the process of compiling an astronomical catalog, Hipparchus noticed that the stars had seemingly shifted from positions <font id=20>noted</font> in Babylonian records from many centuries earlier. [3] He concluded that it was not the stars that were moving but rather the position from which they were being observed that varied. [4] Precession, in turn, is caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon on the bulge at Earth's equator. [5] A wobbling in Earth's axis of <font id=21>rotation, called</font> precession, <font id=22>cause</font> this variation in position. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">As Earth rotates <font id=24>round and round and round</font> like a spinning top, its axis traces a huge circle that takes 26,000 years to <font id=25>complete. As a result, </font> the North Pole's position in relation to the stars <font id=26>change. </font> Astronomers <font id=27>now, know, that, </font> around 3000 BC, Thuban, a star in the tail of the constellation Draco (the Dragon), was directly above the pole. Three thousand years from now, Alderamin, in the constellation Cepheus, <font id=28>is</font> the polestar. Over the 26,000-year cycle, numerous stars will take <font id=29>its' </font> turn as the North Star for a few thousand years each. But the Babylonian records should not be discarded. <font id=30>30</font></div>
