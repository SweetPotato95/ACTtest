<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In some locations, drainage water from agricultural areas contains selenium (Se), a substance that can be harmful to wildlife. Se can be removed from water by plant uptake or by adsorption onto soil and organic particles. Three studies were done to examine Se removal by humanmade wetlands.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Five open-water wetlands (Wetlands l-5), each 15m×76m in area, were constructed at a location in May 1997. At that time, 4 of the wetlands were planted with the same density of l or 2 types of wetland plants. From January 1998 through December 2000, drainage water containing an average Se concentration of 22 micrograms per liter (μg/L) was continuously fed into each wetland at a flow rate of 300<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2012 April 70G\imgs\196.png' width = '93'height = '44'/>.
