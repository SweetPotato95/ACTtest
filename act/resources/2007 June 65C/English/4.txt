<h1>Expanding the Chorus of Voices</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In 2002, Minnesota writer and <font id=46>editor, Mai Neng Moua,</font> created a new literary <font id=47>tradition, with the publication of the first-ever anthology,</font> of Hmong American writers. This collection, Bamboo Among the Oaks, <font id=48>features</font> the fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and drama of twenty-two Hmong Americans. <font id=49>May Lee, a writer from St. Paul, Minnesota, has two essays in the anthology.</font> Most of the <font id=50>featured</font> writers are in their twenties and thirties and live in the Midwest. Many are first-generation Americans who were born in the mountain regions of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, the traditional home of the Hmong.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The works in Moua's anthology <font id=51>records</font> the challenges of adjusting to a new homeland while preserving the writers' ethnic traditions. The voices in the collection are vibrant and new, from writers who are grounded in Hmong culture. A common theme in Moua's collection is the search for identity. Specific topics include assimilation, group identification, and gender and generational conflict.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=54>[1] Before publishing Bamboo Among the Oaks, Moua founded the first Hmong American literary journal. [2] To fill this gap, she decided to <font id=52>nurture</font> <font id=53>the talent of Hmong American writers by creating Paj Ntaub Voice, a bilingual publication in Hmong and English.</font> [3] The idea came to her while she was recovering from surgery. [4] To pass the time, she spent many hours reading, and she discovered that Hmong writers were missing from Asian American anthologies. [5] The first issue, produced in 1994,was a simple collection of pages printed in black ink and stapled. [6].Today, Paj Ntaub Voice is published in full color with standard book binding.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Moua is proud of her accomplishments and <font id=55>those of</font> other Hmong writers in the United States. <font id=56>56</font> Believing that many more voices need to be heard, <font id=57>people in the Hmong community are urged</font> to write, to add their voices to the literary community. She is pleased that, <font id=58>within</font> her anthology, readers nationwide are being <font id=59>introduced to</font> the writing of Hmong Americans. Her hope <font id=60>that</font> college courses in Asian American studies soon will include at least one selection from Bamboo Among the Oaks.</div>
