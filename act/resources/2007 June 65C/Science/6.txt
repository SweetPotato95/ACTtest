The processes that produce bedforms in present-day river channels produced the same types of bedforms in ancient river channels. Ancient bedforms are often found preserved in sedimentary rock layers. Figure l shows a longitudinal cross section of 3 types of bedforms: ripples, dunes, and flat beds.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">A geologist conducted 3 studies using 'an artificial river channel 15 m long. 1 m wide, and 0.6 m deep. Water velocity through the channel and water flow depth could be controlled. At the start of each study, a .flat, 15 cm thick layer of sand particles of uniform diameter was placed in the bottom of the channel. Various combinations of water velocity, from 0.2 m/sec to 2.0 m/sec, and of water flow depth: from 0.1 m to 0.4 m, were tested in each of the 3 studies.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The bottom of the channel was covered with fine sand particles, all having a diameter of 0.19 mm. Water was passed over the sediment bed. The resulting bedform stability fields (water velocities and water flow depths at which various types of bedforms were present) are shown in Figure 2.</div>
