<div class = "para">Air at its dew point temperature (or dew point) is saturated with water vapor. Air temperature usually decreases with increasing altitude. When air cools to its dew point, the water vapor in the air can begin to condense and form clouds.</div>
<div class = "para">Air temperatures and dew points were measured every 600 m from the surface (0 m) to an altitude of 3,000 m at 4 cities (A-D). Data, including the altitude of the cloud base over each city, were taken at 2 P.M. on every summer day that clouds were present. Figures l-4 show the average air temperatures, the average dew points, and the average cloud-base altitudes at each city.</div>

<div class = "quiz">34. The table below shows the average July air temperatures and dew points at o m altitude for Miami, Florida, and for Phoenix, Arizona.
<table>###10</table>Based on this information and the data in Figures 1-4, which of these 2 cities, on average, would have lower cloud based in July?
<div class = "choice">F.Phoenix, because it has a higher average air temperature than Miami.</div>
<div class = "choice">G.Phoenix, because the difference between the average air temperature and the average dew point is larger than in Miami.</div>
<div class = "choice">H.Miami, because it has a lower average air temperature than Phoenix.</div>
