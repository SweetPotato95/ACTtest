<div class = "para">Some students were interested in why antifreeze is mixed with the H<sub>2</sub>O in a car’s radiator. They knew that when a substance is dissolved in H<sub>2</sub>O, the boiling points are elevated and the freezing points are lowered relative to H<sub>2</sub>O. They performed the following experiments to investigate the effects of the addition of ethylene glycol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), the active ingredient in most types of antifreeze, to H<sub>2</sub>O.</div>
<div class = "para">Experiment l</div>
<div class = "para">Six solutions of various concentrations of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in H<sub>2</sub>O were prepared. The mass of 10.00 mL of each solution was measured, and the density of each solution was calculated using the following formula:</div>

<div class = "para">The densities of 100% H<sub>2</sub>O and 100% C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were also determined. The students found that as the concentration of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased, the density of the solution increased.</div>
<div class = "para">Experiment 2</div>
<div class = "para">A 20 mL sample of H<sub>2</sub>O was placed in a flask containing a thermometer and the flask was heated. The temperature at which the H<sub>2</sub>O first started to boil was recorded as the boiling point. This procedure was repeated with C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the solutions prepared in Experiment l (see Figure l).    </div>

<div class = "para">A 90 g sample of H<sub>2</sub>O (freezing point= 0℃) and 10 g of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (freezing point = -11.5℃) were placed in a cup containing a thermometer. The mixture .was stirred as it was cooled in a low-temperature bath. The temperature at which ice crystals first began to appear was recorded as the freezing point. The procedure was repeated with different amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (see Table l).</div>
