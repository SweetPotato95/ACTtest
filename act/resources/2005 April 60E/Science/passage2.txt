Passage II
The rate of a chemical reaction can be measured as the change in the concentration of its products over a period of time. The following experiments were performed to investigate factors that influence the rate at which potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) reacts with oxalic acid (H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>) to form Mn2+ and other products.
Experiment l
A. 4.0 mL sample of 0.1 M (moles/liter) aqueous KMnO<sub>4</sub>. which was purple in color, was measured with a clean graduated cylinder and poured into a test tube. A 4.0 mL sample of l.0 M aqueous H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub> was then measured with a clean graduated cylinder and poured into a second test tube. The 2 test tubes were placed in a 25℃ water bath. After 5 minutes the H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub> solution was mixed with the KMnO<sub>4</sub> solution and placed back in the water bath. The time until the purple color disappeared was recorded. This procedure was repeated at 3 other temperatures. The results are shown in Table l.

Experiment 2
The procedure from Experiment l was repeated in every way except that 0.1 mg of manganous sulfate (MnSO<sub>4</sub>), a catalyst, was added to each test tube containing KMnO<sub>4</sub> before the H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub> was added. Catalysts are substances that increase the rate of reactions without being used up. The results are shown in Table 2.

Experiment 3
The procedure from Experiment 1 was repeated at a constant temperature of 25℃ and various concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>. The results are shown in Table 3.

8. In Experiment l, as the reaction temperature increased, the time until the purple color disappeared:
F. remained the same.   G. decreased only.   H. increased only.   J. increased, then decreased.
9. If the procedure described in Experiment 2 was repeated and a reaction time of 6 sec was .measured, the temperature of the reaction was most likely:
A. less than 25℃.               B. greater than 25℃ and less than 40℃.
C. greater than 40℃ and less than 55℃.             D. greater than 55℃.
10. How is the experimental design of Experiment l different from that of Experiment 2? In Experiment 1:
F. MnSO<sub>4</sub> was not added to the reaction; in Experiment 2 MnSO<sub>4</sub> was added.
G. the concentration of KMnO<sub>4</sub> was less than that used in Experiment 2.
H. reaction temperatures were varied; in Experiment 2 they remained constant.
J. the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was varied; in Experiment 2 it remained constant.
11. Each of the following factors was investigated in the experiments EXCEPT:
A. adding a catalyst to the reaction mixture.         B. changing the reaction solvent.
C. varying the reaction temperature.               D. changing the concentration of a reactant.
12. A. student performed the procedure described in Experiment 1, mixing an H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> solution at 45℃ with a KMnO<sub>4</sub> solution at 40℃. Based on the results of Experiment l, the reaction time was most likely:
F. less than 25 sec.                          G. greater than 25 sec and less than 48 sec.
H. greater than 48 sec and less than 105 sec.          J. greater than 105 sec.
13. A student repeating Trial 9 unknowingly used a graduated cylinder that already contained l.0 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O to measure the H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> solution. Based on the results of Experiment 3, the reaction time that she measured was most likely:
A. less than 415 sec.                B. greater than 415 sec and less than or .equal to 625 sec.
C. greater than 625 sec and less than or equal to 837 sec.              D. greater than 837 sec.
