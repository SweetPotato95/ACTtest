<h1>Zora Neale Hurston, Folklorist</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The Harlem Renaissance author Zora Neale Hurston is well known for her novels, especially Their Eyes Were Watching God, <font id=61>however, </font> she was also a devoted chronicler <font id=62>of</font> African American folklore. In her collection of Southern folktales, Mutes and Men, Hurston, who was born and raised in Eatonville, Florida, suggested her unique qualification for this study when she said she had "the map of Dixie on my tongue."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=63>While she was</font> studying anthropology at Barnard College in New York that Hurston decided to <font id=64>hook up again</font> with the customs, songs, stories, and games she had learned as a child. By her own account, she took the wrong approach to gathering folklore <font id=65>when, </font> in 1927, she first returned to the South. When she asked <font id=66>them</font> if they knew any folktales, they glanced at her nice car and "cit" clothes, shook their heads, and told her to look elsewhere. On her next trip, she headed straight to her hometown, where she already knew the people and the people knew her.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In <font id=67>Eatonville, her hometown, </font> Hurston went to places where she knew the oral tradition <font id=68>would be</font> thriving. <font id=69>She eagerly sought out the porch of the general store. </font> As people gathered at the store her first day there, a wonderful outpouring of tales <font id=70>begun</font> as members of the crowd vied for their turn to tell stories.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Hurston also visited Polk County, Florida, where she sponsored contests for the most imaginative tall tale. The winners received prizes, and Hurston collected a <font id=71>wide vastness</font> of folklore. After the contests, people came to her on their own to share <font id=72>even</font> more stories.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Many of the tales Hurston heard during her Southern trips <font id=73>revealed interesting information: </font> why the woodpecker has a red head, why the alligator is black, or how the snake got its rattles. Other tales were <font id=74>exaggeratedly and humorous</font> accounts of harsh bosses and smarter workers, or of trickster animals such <font id=75>as, Brer Rabbit</font> and his cousins. In part because of Hurston's work, these vibrant stories live on.</div>
