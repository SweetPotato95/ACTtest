<h1>Passage II</h1>
<div class = "para">Harmonica Blues</div>
<div class = "para">For as long as I can remember, <u>16 it is true that</u> I have wanted to play the harmonica. My father played a few tunes marginally well. I often asked him to teach me to play, but I quickly grew <u>17 impatient, with the wheezing, tinny notes</u> that I produced. After two weeks’ effort, <u>18 which</u> I would always set the harmonica aside and <u>19 had went</u> back to the baseball field.</div>
<div class = "para">My father was able to teach me a few things about the harmonica. For instance, he told me that it originated in southern China a round 1100 B.C., this early version, the sheng, consisted of long reeds placed on water in a wooden bowl. At one time the </div>
<div class = "para"><u>21 harmonica, which has its origins in ancient China,</u> was often confused with the armonica, a musical instrument invented by Benjamin Franklin that consisted of glasses played by rubbing the rims with a wet finger. 22 While the harmonica was marketed <u>23 originally</u> as a child’s <u>24 toy</u>, it eventually became a valued portable instrument for folk and blues musicians.</div>
<div class = "para">25 Then, at age fifteen, I decided to enroll in a blues harmonica class. On the first night, the instructor, <u>26 whom had</u> performed in local rock bands for years guided the class through a tortured version of "Mary Had a Little Lamb."</div>
<div class = "para">[1] Then he played the same <u>27 melody, but with such a pure, sad wail that,</u> the entire class sat in stunned silence when he’d finished. [2] When we had finished, he said, "That was Mary Had a Little Lamb." [3] He picked up his own harmonica. [4] "This, however, is ‘Mary Had the Blues.’" [5] He lifted the instrument to his lips. 28</div>
<div class = "para">I returned home determined to learn to play well I worked to find the right mouth holes <u>29 and if I could</u> bend the right notes. All week I wheezed through versions of "Jingle Bells" and "Oh, Susanna." Finally, on the night before our next class, <u>30 which I believe was a Wednesday,</u> in the middle of an attempt at "Old Folks at Home," I pursed my lips and blew a sweet, piercing note that filled the room with lovely sound. I had finally played a proper note on the harmonica, and maybe I’ll someday play the blues.</div>
