<h1>Faith Ringgold's Quilting Bee</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The artist Faith Ringgold has made a name for herself with her "story quilts," lively combinations of painting, quilting, and storytelling. Each artwork consists of a painting framed by quilted squares of fabric and story panels. One of these artworks, The Sunflowers Quilting Bee at Aries, depicts a scene of women at work on a quilt in a field of towering yellow <font id=16>flowers that eight</font> African American women sit around the quilt that covers their laps. Who are these people stitching among the flowers? What brings them so close that .their shoulders touch?</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=17>Thus, the</font> answers to these questions can be found in the artwork itself. Ringgold has told <font id=18>the story of this gathering on two horizontal panels of text.</font> One panel is sewn into the piece's top border, the other into <font id=19>it's</font> bottom border. These eight <font id=20>women the story explains,</font> strove <font id=21>in their various ways</font> to support the cause of justice in the world.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In <font id=22>reality,</font> these women never met to piece together a quilt. The scene comes out of the <font id=23>artists imagination as</font> a statement of the unity of purpose that she perceives in their lives. Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman fought to abolish slavery and, later, <font id=24>was active</font> in the crusade for suffrage. Newspaper journalist Ida B. Wells <font id=25>courageously spoke out for social and racial justice in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</font> Establishing her own hair products <font id=26>business, herself</font> in the first decade of the twentieth century, <font id=27>millions of dollars were later bequeathed by Madam C. J. Walker to charities and educational institutions.</font> Among the schools that benefited from this <font id=28>generosity, were</font> those that Mary McLeod Bethune opened and ran in order to provide a better education for Black students. And Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker, and Rosa Parks showed leadership and strength during the civil rights <font id=29>movement, it happened in</font> the 1950s and 1960s.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In the artwork, Ringgold has surrounded these women with bright sunflowers. <font id=30>The flowers seem to celebrate the women's accomplishments and the beauty of their shared vision.</font></div>
