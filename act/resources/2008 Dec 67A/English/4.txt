<h1>Nancy Drew in the Twenty-First Century</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">I thought the Nancy Drew mystery series had <font id=46>went out of</font> style. I was sure that girls growing up today would have more up-to-date role models and my generation's favorite sleuth <font id=47>would have been</font> retired to the <font id=48>library's dusty,</font> back rooms. I was wrong.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Nancy Drew, the teenaged heroine of <font id=49>heaps</font> of young  adult mystery <font id=50>novels, is alive</font. and well and still, on the job. I know because my niece, Liana, and her friends were reading <font id=51>that</font> all summer long. By the time Liana went back to <font id=52>school and had</font> followed Nancy Drew on a safari to <font id=53>solve</font> The Spider Sapphire Mystery and had explored Incan ruins for clues to The Secret of the Crossword Cipher. <font id=54>With Nancy's help, Liana had read about different places and various cultures all over the world.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">When I was a girl in the 1960s, my friends arid I loved Nancy Drew. <font id=55>55</font>We loved her loyal companions, her bravado, and <font id=56>there was a love for her freedom to do what she wanted.</font> We <font id=57>also</font> loved how smart she was and how pretty, how confident and successful. We were surprised and delighted that eighteen-year-old Nancy was so accomplished at so many things. She <font id=58>was able to solve crimes,</font> win golf tournaments, kick bad guys in the shins, and impress her father's distinguished clients. She did it allâ€”and without scuffing her shoes or losing her supportive boyfriend, Ned.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Liana and her friends don't seem to care that Nancy is pretty or popular. They laugh, mockingly I think, at Nancy's friend Bess, who squeals at spiders. They prefer her other girlfriend George, the judo expert and computer whiz. They skip over the long descriptions of outfits and fashion accessories. According to Liana, they just want to get on with the story.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Perhaps I am overly optimistic, but I'd like to believe that Liana's generation doesn't love Nancy Drew because she's a successful girl detective. They don't need to be reminded that girls can be <font id=59>successful they know</font> that. What these girls need and love are. the stories themselves: <font id=60>those exciting adventure tulles spiced with mystery.</font></div>
