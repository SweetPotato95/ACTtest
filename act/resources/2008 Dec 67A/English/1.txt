<h1>Miami Time</h1>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">My family is part of the Miami <font id=1>tribe a Native American people,</font> with strong ties to territory in present-day Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Growing up in the Midwest, I often heard my grandmother talk about "Miami time." When she was doing something she loved, whether it was <font id=2>making freezer jam or researching tribal history,</font> she refused to be <font id=3>rushed in a hurry.</font> "I'm on Miami time today," she would say. Conversely, if we were running late for an <font id=4>appointment. She</font> would chide us by saying, "Get a move on. We're not running on Miami time today, you know."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=5>It was a difficult concept for me to grasp.</font> My grandmother tried to explain that."Miami time" referred to those <font id=6>moments, when</font> time seemed to slow down or stand still. Recently, the meaning of her <font id=7>words</font> started to sink in.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">One morning, my son and I <font id=8>will inadvertently slip</font> out of the world measured in seconds, minutes, and hours, and into one measured by curiosity and sensation.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=11>[1] On a familiar trail near our house, I was pushing Jeremy in his stroller and <font id=9>were thinking</font> of the day ahead and the tasks I had to complete. [2] Suddenly, he squealed with pure delight and pointed toward a clearing. [3] There, two <font id=10>does and three fawns</font> stood watching us. [4] Five pairs of ears flicked like antennae seeking a signal. [5] After a few moments, the deer lowered their heads and began to eat, as if they had decided we were harmless. [6] By then, my son's face was full of wonder.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">We spent the rest of the morning veering from the trail to investigate small snatches of life. Lizards lazing in the sun and quail <font id=12>rustled</font> through grasses surprised us.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Wild blackberries melted on our tongues. <font id=13>For example, the</font> aroma of crushed eucalyptus leaves tingled in our noses.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">By the time we found our way back to the car, the sun was high in the sky. We had taken three hours to complete a hike we usually finished in forty-five minutes. Yet the hike felt <font id=14>shorter then</font> ever. As we drove off, I remembered something else my grandmother used to say: "Miami time passes all too quickly."</div>
