<h1>Visiting Mars on a budget</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">With its distinctive red tint and its polar ice caps, the planet Mars has fascinated humans for thousands of years. <font id=61>There were</font> ancient Babylonian astronomers who associated Mars with their war god Negral, to twentieth-century science fiction writers <font id=62>whose works become best-sellers,</font> this planet has often been a symbol of ill will and danger.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=63>The United States has competed with other countries to explore space.</font> By 2003, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) <font id=64>would of sent</font> thirty spacecraft to the red planet, <font id=65>speculation has been prompted</font> that a human voyage may no longer be the stuff of fiction. <font id=66>Few</font> would deny that the idea of a human mission to Mars is exciting, who is ready to pay for such an expedition? Recent reports suggest that the cost of a human voyage to Mars could run as high as 100 billion dollars. This is a startling number, especially in light of the fact that the International Space Station, the most ambitious NASA project <font id=67>yet</font>, carried a projected price tag of "only" 17 billion dollars. In the end,. NASA overspent on the International Space Station.<font id=68>68</font> One can only imagine <font id=69>if</font> the final price of a human voyage to Mars would be.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In contrast, the two Mars Rovers— <font id=70>robotic spacecraft launched in 2003—</font> carried a-combined price tag of less than one billion dollars. These Rovers are sophisticated pieces of technology, with the <font id=71>capacity and ability</font> to examine soil and rocks. Their equipment may answer questions that have long been posed about the presence of water and life on Mars.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Sending machines unaccompanied by humans to Mars does drain some of the romance out of <font id=72>aging or older</font> visions of space, travel. <font id=73>In other words,</font> we need to keep in mind that the right equipment can accomplish as much as any crew of scientists, if not more—<font id=74>such as</font> a fraction of the cost. Before any astronaut boards a spacecraft for that distant planet, the staggering expense of such a mission should be carefully considered.<font id=75>75</font></div>
