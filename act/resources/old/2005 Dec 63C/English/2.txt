<h1>Passage II</h1>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">A Family Craft</div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The printshops where my father worked, whether in a publishing house in Vermont or in a small-town newspaper office in Idaho, always presented the same vivid experience. The tap dance of Linotype <u>16 keys</u> the pungent scents of printing ink and cleaning chemicals, and the slapping sound of the rollers dripping with ink-<u>17 every job has its hazards.</div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">It was a special occasion <u>18 for which</u> I could visit my father at work. <u>19 However, he</u> was a Linotype <u>20 operator and, the Linotype machine</u> seemed formidable.</div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">My father’s hands flew across an enormous keyboard that was <u>21 unlike any I saw in other places.</u> As he typed, the machine melted chinks of metal and then formed the molten mass into lines of metal <u>22 type, bright</u> and burning hot, these lines of type—headlines, sentences, phrases—slid out of the machine. Once cooled, these slugs (as the lines of type are called)were taken to a table where the typesetter fit them together by hand into a wooden frame the size of a newspaper page. The frame was set into 'the printing press, inked, and used to print pages. Afterward, the type was cleaned in various chemicals and <u>23 were put</u> back into the <u>24 Linotype to be recreated</u> as tomorrow’s headlines and stories.</div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In the early seventies, the Linotype process was phased out, and my father went to work in the business office. His company had switched to offset printing, a method that relies on photographic images rather than metal type. Since then, computers have further revolutionized the printing industry. When I process text at my computer, <u>25 in my job,</u> I remember my father at his Linotype machine. <u>26 When comparing his workplace to</u> <u>26 mine, it is quiet and clean.</u> The air smells of coffee, <u>27 not tea.</u> Instead of stained and scuffed wooden tables, I’m surrounded by sleek vinyl office furniture. But <u>28 in essence,</u> my father’s work and mine are the most alike. From him, I inherited faithfulness to the written word and care in sending it out into the world.</div>
