<h1>Passage V</h1>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">A Night at the Vanguard</div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">My friend Stacia and I recently took a class in jazz music, so one night we went down to the Village Vanguard to hear a <u>61 performance, by saxophonist,</u> Jackie McLean. The Vanguard is a New York City nightclub located underground in a room crowded with tables.  Photos of Billie Holiday, Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane, and other jazz greats <u>63 on</u> the walls.</div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">To our surprise, Stacia and I found empty seats near the stage. The backup band of a pianist, a bass player, and the <u>64 talented</u> Billy Higgins started with a piece Stacia and I immediately recognized—"Seven Minds."</div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">My attention focused <u>65 first with</u> Higgins, who played with his head tipped back, smiling and nodding. Soon McLean stepped onstage with his <u>66 sax</u> I wasn’t <u>67 prepared for the impact.</u> Into every corner of the room, he blew wild, sweet, almost disjointed notes <u>68 that seemed to leave many listeners amazed.</u> He didn’t play according to the rules of the popular music <u>69 I had grown up listening to</u> on the radio. McLean has been likened to the sax genius Charlie Parker, and that night I could hear why.</div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[1] Occasionally McLean would stroll offstage.[2]Then one of the other musicians <u>70 taking the lead, pulling</u> strange patterns from his instrument, <u>71 the equivalent in sound of someone dancing under a blinking strobe light.</u> [3] Once during a drum solo, a man near us started laughing, as if Higgins had just told a mischievous joke. [4] Now and then, one member of the audience or another would bend forward <u>72 as if you were</u> intently following an argument that is both complicated and fascinating. [5] When he played, something happy happened inside me. [6] I closed my eyes and just listened. </div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Suddenly the show was over. The musicians walked <u>74 offstage. The</u> room filled with applause. Moments later, we were outside where the whole city—cabs, couples, neon lights—seemed to be moving to that bright, hectic, spontaneous music.</div>
