<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Finding Tomatoes in Winter</div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[1] When I was growing up on our farm in North Carolina, my favorite chore was canning tomatoes with my mother. [2] In our one-acre garden, the <u>1 weight of the</u> tomato plants would slump with ripening fruit, the stems would break, and the pungent smell of late summer would be released. [3] <u>2 Pleasantly heavy and warm from the sun, I can still imagine the feel of the fruit.</u> [4] That smell told us that it was time to walk the vines and <u>3 the best of the being selected for canning.</u> </div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">We washed the tomatoes in the kitchen while a large pot of water heated up on the stove.  When the water came to a boil, we dropped the tomatoes into the pot for exactly on minute, retrieved them, and then plunged them into ice water. This double dunking loosened the skin so we could easily peel it a way from the juicy, red pulp.</div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><u>6 Next, my mother and I,</u> cored the tomatoes. Then came my favorite part: crushing them into small pieces to fit into the canning jars. I can see myself now, standing in a steamy kitchen, <u>7 overalls spattered with pulp, sweat</u> dripping from my chin. It was impossible to keep a straight face as seeds squirted through the <u>8 air and stuck to the walls around us.</u> Sometimes we sang along with the radio, frequently substituting the word tomato for a prominent word in the song.  Sometimes the only sound in the kitchen would be the fan, rotating on <u>10 its’ squeaky</u> hinge, sending a breeze our way. Patches of salt <u>11 forming</u> on our faces and arms as our sweat evaporated into the August air.</div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Once the chore was finished, the tomatoes would line the pantry shelves alongside spiced peaches and snap beans, <u>12 all gleaming colorfully in their jars.</u> Together they were our <u>13 familys’</u> protection against the bleak winter.</div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Now I live a long way from my family and their farm in North Carolina. In the winter, I savor the fresh supply of the half dozen or so jars of tomatoes Mom sends me every year. On special occasions, I reach for one, twist off the top, and let the smell of summer drift back <u>14 to</u> me from my childhood. </div>
