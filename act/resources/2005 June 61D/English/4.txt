<h1>The Nguyen Family Restaurant</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">For my friends Tran and Maya Nguyen, the distance <font id=46>between</font> Vietnam and California is more than <font id=47>it's</font> measure in miles. <font id=48>Although immigrants, </font> Tran, Maya, and their four children left much behind, including their family restaurant. <font id=49>Now</font> they want to run a restaurant is Los Angeles just as they did in Da Nang.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=51>When Tran visited Vietnamese restaurants in the Los Angeles area, he was <font id=50>impressed, with both, </font> their décor and their menus but shocked to learn how much it costs to rent a suitable building. </font> He knew that <font id=52>himself and Maya</font> would have to <font id=53>apply their energies to the activity of labor</font> for the money needed to sign a lease.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">During their first year in the United States, they found jobs and began to save money. Tran worked as a hospital <font id=54>clerk, and</font> Maya was an assembler in an electronics factory. <font id=55>Nevertheless, </font> they were a long way from what they would need. <font id=56>They knew their jobs would help them to raise the necessary funds. </font> After two years, they had more than doubled their savings but were still short of their goal.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=57>Tran worked hard at his job. </font> He decided to rent a food vendor's cart that he could manage on his days off from the hospital. He knew the perfect location on a busy street corner. In less that a week, Tran was selling cha gio (egg rolls) on that corner. Soon they rented a second cart for Maya to operate. This undertaking wasn't their dream but perhaps <font id=58>their dream would lead to it. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Recently, Maya saw what seemed to her the perfect building for rent. The neighborhood was friendly, with lots of foot <font id=59>traffic. She</font> envisioned their restaurant fitting in nicely here. But she was disappointed when she talked to the real estate <font id=60>agent—the</font> building wouldn't be available for six months. Maya went home and discussed the situation with Tran. They were discouraged but realized that they could use this time to acquire much of the equipment they would need. Last night they decided to name their future restaurant after their son, Haing. That was also the name of their restaurant back in Vietnam.</div>
