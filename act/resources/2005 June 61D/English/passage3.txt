Passage III
The ＄275,000 Sack of Flour
In April 1864, during the Civil War, the Nevada mining town of Austin held its first mayoral election. Mr. Reuel Gridley, a grocer, entered into a friendly wager <u>31 for</u> the election’s outcome with a Dr. Buel Herrick. <u>32 Nevertheless,</u> that wager would <u>33 benefit</u> many Civil War soldiers in an unforeseen way.
The <u>34 bets terms</u> stated that the loser of the <u>35 wager, escorted by a marching band,</u> must carry a fifty-pound sack of flour one mile along Austin’s Main Street. <u>36 While voters</u> elected the candidate that Dr. Herrick <u>37 supported, choosing that person to be mayor.
Mr. Gridley, the loser, then decorate a sack of flour with red, white, and blue <u>38 ribbons: shouldered it;</u> and led the band through Austin. At the parade’s end, he offered the flour to the highest bidder, starting with his own ＄200 bid. He stated that proceeds would go to the U.S. Sanitary Commission, <u>39 an organization equivalent and similar to</u> today’s Red Cross, to aid Civil War soldiers.
Bidding became <u>40 brisk. Townspeople</u> felt compassion for the soldiers fighting in the eastern United States. The successful bidder <u>41 donates</u> the sack of flour back to Gridley to be auctioned off again. Each <u>42 time that Gridley</u> started the bidding anew. In two days, the sack sold 112 times, for amounts ranging from ＄10 to ＄350. Gridley collected ＄4,350 for the Sanitary Commission. By comparison, Sanitary Commission donation boxes left at voting polls had received only ＄200.
<u>43 Being inspiring and motivating himself,</u> Gridley traveled to Virginia City, Nevada, to auction the sack of flour to <u>44 its</u> residents. Money poured in Gridley trekked to California: San Franciscans donated ＄2,800, and Sacramento’s citizens gave ＄10,000. Gridley then proceeded to St. Louis and to major eastern cities. These bidders added ＄170,000 to the Sanitary Commission’s <u>45 fund. Within</u> twelve months Gridley’s sack of flour had earned ＄275,000.
Reuel Gridley died penniless in 1870. In 1914 family members donated the farmous flour sack to the Nevada Historical Society in Reno, where it remains, a reminder of his hard work and the generosity of many.
