<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The male-to-female body mass ratio (MFMR) of a species can be calculated as follows:</div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">MFMR=<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2005 June 61D\imgs\177.png' width = '106'height = '42'/></div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In this equation, <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2005 June 61D\imgs\178.png' width = '49'height = '42'/>is the average body mass of adult males and <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2005 June 61D\imgs\179.png' width = '35'height = '42'/> is the average body mass of adult females.</div>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The figure shows the MFMR of some species within 4 primate groups: apes and humans; Old World monkeys; New World monkeys; and prosimians. A species with an MFMR of 1 is monomorphic with respect to body mass. A species with an MFMR different than 1 is dimorphic with respect to body mass. (Note: In the figure, MFMR values are calculated to the nearest tenth.)</div>
