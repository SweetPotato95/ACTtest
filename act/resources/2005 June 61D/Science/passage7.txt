Passage VII
The male-to-female body mass ratio (MFMR) of a species can be calculated as follows:
MFMR=<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2005 June 61D\imgs\177.png' width = '128'height = '50'/>
In this equation, <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2005 June 61D\imgs\178.png' width = '58'height = '50'/>is the average body mass of adult males and <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2005 June 61D\imgs\179.png' width = '42'height = '50'/> is the average body mass of adult females.
The figure shows the MFMR of some species within 4 primate groups: apes and humans; Old World monkeys; New World monkeys; and prosimians. A species with an MFMR of 1 is monomorphic with respect to body mass. A species with an MFMR different than 1 is dimorphic with respect to body mass. (Note: In the figure, MFMR values are calculated to the nearest tenth.)

36. According to the figure, the body mass of the average adult male orangutan is how many times greater than the body mass of the average adult female orangutan?
F. 1.1  G. 1.4  H. 1.6  J. 1.9
37. Which of the following statements about the relative size of male and female chimpanzees and aye-ayes is consistent with the information provided?
A. Both chimpanzees and aye-ayes are dimorphic with respect to body mass.
B. Both chimpanzees and aye-ayes are monomorphic with respect to body mass.
C. Chimpanzees are dimorphic with respect to body mass, and aye-ayes are monomorphic with respect to body mass.
D. Chimpanzees are monomorphic with respect to body mass, and aye-ayes are dimorphic with respect to body mass.
38. According to the figure, which of the following primate groups has the largest proportion of monomorphic species?
F. Apes  G. Old World monkeys  H. New World monkeys  J. Prosimians
39. On average, which of the following types of apes shown in the figure has the greates MFMR?
A. Gibbons  B. Chimpanzees  C. Orangutans  D. Gorillas
40. Which of the following best explains the units of measure that are associated with the MFMR?
F. The numerator is in units of mass and the denominator is in units of mass, so the ratio has no units.
G. The numerator is in units of mass and the denominator is in units of mass, so the ratio is in units of mass.
H. The numerator is in units of volume and the denominator is in units of volume, so the ratio has no units.
J. The numerator is in units of volume and the denominator is in units of volume, so the ratio is in units of volume.
