Passage II
Crude oil contains thousands of chemical compounds. To obtain commercially useful compounds, crude oil is distilled in a fractionating tower (see Figure 1). The crude oil is first heated to 400℃ in a furnace, then pumped into the fractionating tower. As vapors from the oil rise, they cool and condense. Fractions are collected at different heights in the tower. Each fraction contains a mixture of hydrocarbon molecules with similar boiling points. Table 1 shows information about some of the fractions that can be collected. Figure 2 shows the composition of crude oils obtained in 6 different geographic locations.

8. According to the information in Table 1, hydrocar bon molecules each having 14 carbon atoms would most likely be found in which of the following fractions?
F. Gasoline  G. Kerosene  H. Fuel oil  J. Lubricating oil
9. Based on the data in Table 1, a fraction containing a mixture of hydrocarbons ranging in size from 8 to 14 carbon atoms per molecule would mot likely have a boiling range:
A. below 20℃.  B. between 20℃ and 100℃.
C. between 100℃ and 250℃.  D. above 250℃.
10. Based on the information in Figure 1 and Table 1, a fraction containing a hydrocarbon that has 7 carbon atoms per molecule would most likely be collected:
F. near the top of the fractionating tower.  G. in the middle of the fractionating tower.
H. near the bottom of the fractionating tower.  J. in the furnace.
11. Based on the information in Figure 1 and Table 1, hydrocarbons found in the residue most likely contain:
A. 1 to 6 carbons per molecule.  B. 7 to 12 carbons per molecule.
C. 13 to 18 carbons per molecule.  D. more than 18 carbons per molecule.
12. Is the statement “Oils boiling at temperatures above 340℃ make up the largest proportion of each of the 6 crude oils shown in Figure 2” Supported by Figure 2?
F. Yes; oils boiling above 340℃ make up more than 20% of the 6 crude oils.
G. Yes; gasoline makes up the smallest proportion of the 6 crude oils.
H. No; oils boiling above 340℃ make up the smallest proportion of Crude Oil Sample F.
J. No; gasoline and middle distillates make up more than 70% of Crude Oil Sample A.
