<h1>Roberto Clemente in Right Field</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[1]   Roberto Clemente, the Pittsburgh Pirates right fielder from 1955 to 1972, was <font id=61>one of baseballs</font> most gifted athletes. He was <font id=62>entitled</font> the National League Batting Champion four times, the National League Most Valuable Player (MVP).in 1966, and the World Series MVP  <font id=63>in 1971</font>. In recognition of his fielding skills, he was awarded twelve consecutive Gold Gloves. In 1973, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[2]   While Clemente's achievements in the sport of baseball are <font id=64>impressive. His</font> charity work off the field has marked <font id=65>himself</font> as one of the greatest humanitarians in professional sports. Tragically, it was during one of his goodwill missions that Clemente's life was cut short. In 1972, Clemente <font id=66>died in a</font> plane crash <font id=67>while delivering</font> relief supplies to earthquake victims in Nicaragua.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=71>[3]  [1] At the time of his death. Clemente was planning long-term humanitarian <font id=68>projects, which were designed to last for years.</font> [2] A few years <font id=69>later, his wife Vera,</font> fulfilled this dream by founding the Roberto Clemente Ciudad Deportiva (Sports City) in Puerto Rico. [3] Each year, this 304-acre sports, counseling, and education center provides thousands of Puerto Rican youths the chance for a better life. [4] One of them was <font id=70>for children</font> a sports complex in his homeland.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[4]    In 1993, Clemente's eldest son, Roberto Clemente Jr., established the Roberto Clemente Foundation. The foundation's primary funding project, the RBI (Reviving Baseball in the Inner City) Program, offers baseball, Softball, and educational opportunities for disadvantaged Pittsburgh-area teenagers.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[5]    Clemente's example has also motivated major leaguers to participate in humanitarian projects. Since 1970, Major League Baseball has <font id=72>presented an award annual</font> recognizing the player who best exemplifies the <font id=73>principals of</font> sportsmanship and community service. In 1973, the award was renamed the Roberto Clemente Award.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[6]    While Clemente's exemplary baseball record remains fixed for the ages, the effects of his generosity continue to expand, <font id=74>as the story of his life is told to others.</font></div>
