<h1>In Remembrance of a Student Hero</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=51>[1] When Mario Savio died in 1996, newspaper stories recounted the events that had put him in the national spotlight more than thirty years earlier. [2] In 1964, Savio was a philosophy major and a member of the executive committee of the Free Speech Movement at the University of California at Berkeley. [3] <font id=46>During the height of the United States presidential election campaign,</font> the Free Speech Movement had organized to fight the university's decision to limit the activities of those groups on campus. [4] The son of working-class parents, Savio grew up in Queens, New York. [5] He had volunteered to do civil rights work in <font id=47>Mississippi, the twentieth state admitted to the Union,</font> during the Freedom Summer of <font id=48>1964 before</font> returning to classes that fall. [6] Along with many others, Savio reacted fiercely when the university banned civil rights groups from setting up information tables on the campus plaza. [7] <font id=49>That stuff</font> led to a student strike <font id=50>and</font> a sit-in protest at the main administration building.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">On December 2, 1964, Savio spoke <font id=52>insistently</font> to <font id=53>a countless group</font> of protesters: "There is a time when the operation of the machine… makes you so sick at heart that you can't take part… and you've got to make it stop." <font id=54>That day,</font> Savio and 800 other protesters were taken to jail in the largest mass arrest in California history. Days later, the California Board of Regents voted to override the university <font id=55>ban and</font> granted full speech rights on the Berkeley campus.<font id=56>56</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The Free Speech Movement changed campus life in the United States. It <font id=57>made</font> a powerful case for the students' right to freedom of speech. <font id=58>It also</font> popularized the <font id=59>sit-in, as a protest tactic,</font> became a model for student rallies and protests across the country. As for Mario Savio, he went on to earn a master's degree in physics. He <font id=60>then taught mathematics</font> and physics in high schools and, for his last six years, at Sonoma State University, where he led protests against student fee increases. Whether a student or a teacher, Savio applied the belief that ordinary people banding together can make change happen.</div>
