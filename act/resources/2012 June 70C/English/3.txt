<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The Guerrilla Girls are a group of women who use humor to protest sexism and racism in the art world and <font id=31>more! </font> The group <font id=32>began in New York City, in 1985</font> a year after several of the future members protested at a major exhibition of contemporary art at the Museum of Modern Art. Of the 166 artists displayed, <font id=33>the majority had their work shown in temporary exhibition space. </font> The show's curator proclaimed that any artist not appearing in the show should start rethinking "his" career. The protestors picketed outside the museum, but <font id=34>notice was not largely given to them by</font> passersby. So the future Guerrilla Girls <font id=35>generated an unusual strategy. </font></div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">To call attention more dramatically to issues of discrimination, the women started wearing gorilla masks at their public <font id=36>appearances; after</font> one member accidentally wrote gorilla instead of guerrilla on a poster. [A] <font id=38>They also <font id=37>assumed alternative names that were</font> the names of deceased female artists and writers, responding in interviews under the pseudonyms Frida Kahlo, Gertrude Stein, Kathe Kollwitz, and others. </font> By remaining anonymous, the Guerrilla Girls believe they avoid the distractions of individual personalities and call greater attention to the issues.

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The Guerrilla Girls create posters that often use statistics and almost always use sarcasm to expose the <font id=39>exclusion of women</font> and people of color from art exhibitions. [C] The Guerrilla Girls' materials also address a variety of topics, including body image and economic injustice. <font id=40>Starting with their first award in 1987, </font> the group bas received honors for their books, posters, and performances.

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[4]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Guerrilla Girl members <font id=41>continue to tour</font> the United States and Europe, speaking on college campuses, at cultural centers, and to various media outlets. <font id=42>Being that they use</font> irreverent wit and satire, their protests have motivated many people to <font id=43>consider choosing a career in an artistic field. </font></div>
