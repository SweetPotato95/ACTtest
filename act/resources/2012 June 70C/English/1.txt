<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">It was late afternoon when my <font id=1>friends and I arrived, </font> at the Scottish castle, <font id=2>an old</font> structure of massive gray stones. The turrets piercing the sky and the gargoyles <font id=3>snarling</font> at us from every jagged ledge sent me straight into the Dark Ages. A forest crowded in on all sides as if trying to smother the <font id=4>castle, like</font> a dragon's tongue, a red flag snapped in the March wind. I was thrilled.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Our spring break trip to Europe was low-budget Lumpy beds, broken television sets, and inexpensive meals were the norm. But we <font id=5>had agreed</font> ahead of time to splurge on one night in a castle. In making our plans, <font id=6>a Scooby-Doo episode came to my mind as I pictured it. </font> I wanted a creepy castle. <font id=7>7</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">My hopes, however, were quickly dashed. A cheerful woman in a flower print dress greeted us. Her name was Pam. That didn't sound like the name of someone who lives in a castle. I was expecting Guinevere or Lady Larkspur. Chatting about laundry facilities and mealtimes, Pam led <font id=8>us through an entryway; </font> jumble of backpacks and <font id=9>umbrellas. </font> In the kitchen, she poured apple juice into plastic cups for her kids, who were finishing off a plate of animal crackers. This was not my idea of life in a castle. Where were the goblets? The torches? The spiderwebs and secret passageways?</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=10 >Upstairs, things were no better. </font> A vase of fresh flowers sat next to a bowl of fruit on a gleaming table in our wallpapered bedroom. Everything <font id=11>smelled like soap and looked</font> like the inside of a cottage. I wanted haunted. I got homey.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">That evening, no trapdoors opened, no monsters rumbled in the dungeon. Instead, we stumbled upon a cozy family room. The walls there were adorned <font id=12>in which there were</font> heartwarming messages in frames. <font id=13>Where there should have been tapestries of battle scenes, </font> we found photographs of cute kids and <font id=14>admirable creatures. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The next <font id=15>morning after that night, </font> on the train to our next destination, we finally laughed at how "scary" our castle visit had been. Then we finished the last of the homemade muffins from Pam.</div>
