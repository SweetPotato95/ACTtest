<h1>Hawaii’s Haleakala Ahinahina Plant</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">One of Earth's most spectacular plants grows on the slopes of Haleakala <font id=16>16</font>. As a species, the Haleakala ahinahina thrived for thousands of years in this sometimes-harsh environment of high winds and subfreezing temperatures where almost no other <font id=17>plants would of been</font> able to survive.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=26> [1] The <font id=18>dagger-shaped, lime green leaves</font> of the plant <font id=19>with a covering of</font> a dense layer of silvery hairs. [2] The plant lives from fifteen to fifty years and at the end of <font id=20> it's</font> life sprouts a dazzling stalk of maroon, sunflower-like blossoms. [3] The stalk may <font id=21>reach</font> a height of eight feet and bear up to six hundred flower heads. [4] By the 1920s, tourism and the introduction of cattle, goats, and other nonnative grazing <font id=22>animals</font> drove this plant to the brink of extinction. [5] <font id=23>Tourist's</font> decreased the plant population by taking home specimens as souvenirs. [6] They also inflicted harm <font id=24>which</font> unintentionally crushing the fragile roots when walking on the soil near the plant. [7] Even gently touching the Haleakala ahinahina can mean death for the plant, whose delicate silver hairs protect <font id=25>itself from</font> solar radiation and dehydration. [8] Moreover, the plant has none of the natural defenses—such as thorns, bitter-tasting foliage, or poisonous chemicals—that might otherwise protect it from grazing animals. </font></div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In the 1920s, <font id=27>alarmed about being endangered, </font> the Maui Chamber of Commerce petitioned Congress, asking that a <font id=28>serious effort be made, </font> to save the plant. The first <font id=29>reliable count</font> of Haleakala ahinahina was made in the summer of 1935. At that time, 1,470 plants were tallied.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Over the past sixty years, the species has been protected by the National Park Service and has <font id=30>been written about. </font> Previous threats from animal grazing and human activities have been eliminated in large part because of fencing and rules prohibiting hikers from leaving established walking paths. As a result, today there are more than 40,000 Haleakala ahinahina growing in or around the volcano.</div>
