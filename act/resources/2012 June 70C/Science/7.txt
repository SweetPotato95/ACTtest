<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">First, the physicist measured <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2012 June 70C\imgs\241.png' width = '24'height = '38'/> for a source of <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2012 June 70C\imgs\242.png' width = '19'height = '27'/>-rays having an energy of 4 million electron volts (MeV). Next, with this same <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2012 June 70C\imgs\243.png' width = '19'height = '27'/>-ray source, she measured I for various sheets of Material 1, each having a different thickness x.

Finally, the physicist plotted a graph of <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2012 June 70C\imgs\254.png' width = '42'height = '38'/> versus <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2012 June 70C\imgs\255.png' width = '19'height = '27'/>-ray energy for each material (see Figure 3).</div>
