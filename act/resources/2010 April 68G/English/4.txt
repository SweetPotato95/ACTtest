<h1>Blue Jeans: Everything Old Is New Again</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In the late 1800s, clothing store <font id=46>owner, Levi Strauss</font> patented the practice of putting rivets, tiny metal studs, on the stress points of men's "waist overalls." Waist overalls, which eventually would be known as jeans, were made out of <font id=47>denim,</font> a durable cotton cloth used especially for work clothes. Strauss's denim pants with rivets were the first pants to be called jeans. Over time, various styles and <font id=48>designers'</font> of jeans have garnered a share of public devotion. Independent of brand names, though, jeans have historic significance <font id=49>regardless of brand name</font> and, for many of us, emotional significance. <font id=50>50</font> Through the 1920s, waist overalls or jeans <font id=51>we're primary</font> considered work pants. However, in the 1930s, due to the increasingly admired image of the rugged, jeans-wearing Western cowboy, jeans became associated with <font id=52>the two main real values that are held by daring adventurers whose lives aren't average.</font> In the 1950s, young film stars such as James Dean and Marlon Brando, T-shirted and jeans-wearing renegades who listened to rock music, wore their blue jeans in the spirit of rebellion. <font id=54>In the 1960s and 1970s, hippies personalized <font id=53>there</font> jeans—which had taken on the relaxed look of the wide "bell" bottom—with embroidery, quilted patches, and beads.</font></div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=56> [1] Boot-cut, low-rise, extra-baggy carpenter-style jeans—an assortment of playful styles—gained popularity in the 1990s.[2] High-fashion clothing designers commonly <font id=55>featured</font> jeans as a part of their. clothing lines in the l980s, and designer jeans quickly became part of mainstream fashion. [3] Styles continue to evolve, of course. [4] Every year it seems there's a new favorite look or fit.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">As jeans-lovers have entered the corporate world, they have popularized a casual work look, wearing jeans as the basic wardrobe <font id=57>to seem</font> laid-back but actually ambitious new professionalism. Jeans, at once gritty and earthy, urban and rural, <font id=58>fashionable and simple,</font> are casual but also convey an underlying assertiveness that no other staple of our wardrobes can match.</div>
