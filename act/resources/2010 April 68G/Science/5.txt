<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Figures l-3 each show how a property of solutions of, ethylene oxide in H<sub>2</sub>O varies as the concentration of ethylene oxide increases at 1 atmosphere (atm) of pressure. Concentration is given as the percent ethylene oxide by mass in H<sub>2</sub>O (% EO). Figure l shows how density at l0℃ varies with % EO. Figure 2 shows how freezing point varies with % EO. The bubble point is the lowest temperature at which bubbles of gas (in this case, ethylene oxide) form in a solution. Figure 3 shows how bubble point varies with % EO.</div>
