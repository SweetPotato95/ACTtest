<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Two species of aquatic plants, Species A and Species B, are often found in the same freshwater lakes. Both species can grow in water up to 2 m deep. However, typically, Species A is found closer to the lake's edge in shallower water whereas Species B grows farther out in deeper water. Both species spread by means of underground stems called rhizomes and by means of seeds. A scientist conducted 2 studies to examine the effect of water depth on the growth of Species A and Species B plants from seeds.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Study 1</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In early Jun e, seeds from Species A and Species B were germinated. In mid-June, 24 seedlings of each species, all having shoot lengths of 3 cm to 5 cm, were transferred to identical pots (1 seedling per pot). The pots were suspended beneath the water in large outdoor tanks that were located in full Sun. Eight seedlings of each species were submerged to each of 3 water depths-0.2 m, 0.4 m, and 0.8 m. In late September, the average shoot length for surviving Species A seedlings and Species B seedlings at each of the 3 water depths was determined. The results are shown in Figure l.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Immediately after Study l, the surviving seedlings of Species A and B were removed from the tanks, dried, and then weighed. The average dry mass of the surviving Species A seedlings from each water depth was 2.3 mg. The average dry mass of the surviving Species B seedlings from each water depth is shown in Figure 2.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">For each water depth, the shoot length and dry mass of each surviving Species B seedling were plotted, The best-fit curve for each set of data points is shown in Figure 3.</div>
