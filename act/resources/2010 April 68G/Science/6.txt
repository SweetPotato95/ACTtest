<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In a rain cloud, small particles called cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) attract nearby water droplets to form a cloud droplet. A cloud droplet grows by attracting more water droplets until it becomes a raindrop, which then falls from the cloud. Rainfall can be increased by seeding the cloud with additional small particles, such as NaCl particles, to act as CCN.</div>

As the plane entered the base of a cloud, a computer determined whether or not to immediately ignite at least l flare, seeding the cloud. The computer also selected which type of flare to ignite, and how many flares to ignite to introduce a concentration of 10,100, 1,000, or 10,000 particles/cm<sup>3</sup> into the cloud. The average amount of rainfall from the seeded clouds for each type of flare and at each concentration is shown in Figure l.</div>
