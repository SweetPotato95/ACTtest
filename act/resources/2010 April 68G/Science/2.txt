<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">S. cerevisiae (baker's yeast) cells can form colonies (patches of genetically identical ceils) on nutrient agar plates（NAPs), each of which contains the same 20 amino acids, The pattern of colonies on l NAP can be reproduced on another NAP using the technique of replica plating. A velvet cloth is pressed onto the first NAP so that the cloth collects cells from each colony. The cloth is then pressed onto a new NAP to transfer the cells, which, when incubated, grow to form colonies (see Figure l).</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Students determined if 10 strains (Strains l-10) of S. cerevisiae could grow in the absence of certain amino acids. Cells from Strain l were spread on an NAP, which was then incubated at 30℃ for 72 hr to allow colonies to form. Cells from each colony were replica plated to each of 4 experimental plates (EPs). The EPs were identical to the NAPs except that each EP lacked l amino acid-either arginine (Arg), histidine (His), lysine (Lys), or leucine (Leu)-while still containing the remaining 19 amino acids. This process was also followed with Strains 2-10. All the EPs were incubated at 30℃ for 72 hr and then examined for colonies (see Table l).</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The students tested 3 mixed cultures (Mixed Cultures E, F, and G), each containing cells from 2 of the strains tested in Experiment 1. Each mixed culture was incubated on a separate NAP until colonies formed. The colonies were then replica plated and incubated as in Experiment1 (see Figure 2).</div>
