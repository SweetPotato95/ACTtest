<h1>Here Comes the Garbage Truck!</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In 1917, the year our house was <font id=61>built. The city planners had an orderly scheme <font id=62>about the collection of trash. Garbage cans would be picked up from the narrow alleys <font id=63>that ran behind the rows of houses. The <font id=64>standard-width sidewalks <font id=65>with which the houses faced would remain free of trash receptacles.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">For six or seven decades, this is the way <font id=66>things would have worked. Garbage trucks <font id=67>squeezed through the back alleys, collecting trash. However, the construction of new vehicles in recent years put an end to the city designers' plans. Today's garbage trucks are enormous, far wider that the slender alleys. <font id=68>Unlike the older trucks, they are painted bright yellow.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Garbage cans must now be placed on the front sidewalk and collected from the main <font id=69>street. What was once hidden away behind the houses <font id=70>are now out in the open, for all to see. How disappointed those early town leaders would be to see this public <font id=71>display of trash.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=75> [1] Yet, the new system has an unexpected benefit. [2] It has made the mechanical gymnastics of the garbage truck much more visible to our neighborhood's young children, <font id=72>who delight in watching the show. [3] A fire engine is bright red and loud, but it doesn't pass by often. [4] For them, the garbage truck is even better than a fire engine. [5] The garbage truck, on the other hand, is a weekly <font id=73>visitor and exotic in its own way. [6] Its best features are hard to <font id=74>beat the bright yellow paint, the sound of the warning horn as it backs up, and, most amazing of all, the way its mechanical arm lifts and dumps the trash cans into its open back end. â–¡75</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Sometimes the neighbors and I complain to each other about the garbage truck. It is loud, we agree, and it blocks the street. But then whatever qualms I might have are quickly erased by the children's excitement. If those long-ago city planners could see the curiosity and amazement on the children's faces, I'm sure they would feel the same way.</div>
