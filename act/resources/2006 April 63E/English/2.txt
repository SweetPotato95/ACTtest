<h1>A Propensity for Pens</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"You have plenty of pens," my friend said gently. "Give me mine back."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=18>I often find myself in this situationÔºçsheepishly handing back someone <font id=16>else's</font> pen. I'm the type who inadvertently attempts to walk away with the pen at the bank, even though it's chained to the counter. This is not a deliberate <font id=17>act, which</font> I just unconsciously assume that all pens belong to me. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Perhaps this is because <font id=19>being</font> a writer and I never really feel comfortable without a pen in my possession. I usually carry <font id=20>a good solid fistful</font> of pens in my backpack. I simply feel better <font id=21>to know</font> a pen is handy. Who knows when <font id=22>they</font> will run dry?</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Maybe I'm afraid an important thought will come to me and I'll have no way to record it. You can always capture an idea by scribbling a sentence on a napkin, a bit of newspaper, or even your hand. As long as you have a pen, paper is a secondary concern.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Pens are also featured prominently at my bedside. Small piles of uncapped ballpoints <font id=23>gather</font> as if of their own accord, on my night table. <font id=24>24</font> Althought I can't think of a time when I have actually woken up in the middle of the night with a brilliant thought, the pens' presence indicates my continuing belief that someday I might.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">My pen habit, like most habits, is not without <font id=25>it's</font> negative consequences. I'm not just referring to the embarrassment of being caught walking off with someone else's property. There's <font id=26>still</font> the fact that most of my clothes <font id=27>have been decorating</font> with ink stains from leaking pens or scrawls from moments of unconscious doodling.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=29> [1] <font id=28>After a recent mishap involving</font> half of my travel wardrobe, my father convinced me not to pack pens in my suitcase. [2] And to me, that feels like traveling light. [3] The low air pressure in the plane's cargo hold is bound to make them leak and ruin my clothes. [4] Despite such calamities, I still travel with at least five pens, capped but ready in my pocket. </font></div>
