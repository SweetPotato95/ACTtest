<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from the novel Monkey King by Patricia Chao (? 1997 by Patricia Chao).</div>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">It's my tenth birthday. Ma doesn't get a cake or presents because we're busy getting ready to go to visit our Nai-nai in San Diego. That is, my sister, Marty, and I are going while Ma and Daddy spend the summer in Taiwan, where my father has a teaching job. In the front of the tunnel to the plane Ma hands us over to the stewardess, who wears white gloves. Marty cries but I don't.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">During the flight the stewardess keeps coming over with childrens magazines, coloring books, magnetic tic-tac-toe. Not that we need distractions; we sit quietly, buckling our seat belts when the sign says to. Most of the way I read Eight Cousins, feeling my sister's hot skull pressed against my shoulder as she sleeps.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">My Nai-nai is so glad to see us, she has tears in her eyes. "Ni kan!" she says to her cousin Su-yi, who has ocme to the airport too because our grandmother doesn't drive. Nai-nai used to live with Su-yi, but now she has a separate house on the same street.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Ma has warned us not to tire Nai-nai out. But my grandmother is inexhaustible. Mornings, when she comes to wake us, she's already dressed, hair up, face powdered, lipstick on. The first night when she tucks us in Marty asks, "When do you go to bed?" and Nai-nai answers: "Very, very late. Old lady doesn't need much sleep."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Over my grandmother's shoulder I am watching the curtains, patterned with cobalt and fuchsia primroses, dancing over the open window. I have brought Piggy, although I am way too old. Marty left her doll on her pillow at home. <font id=7>Nai-nai doesn't make fun of me. </font> "Poor old man," she says, when she notices Piggy's tattered chest. She looks in her drawers and finds a baby T-shirt I can dress him in.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Marty and I play softball and kickball with the kids on our street. Sometimes we go to the beach, along with a lot of other kids in bathing suits, crowded into the back of a station wagon that smells like hot rubber and coconut lotion. It is the most beautiful ocean I have ever seen, with all different kinds of blue in it, rolling like fluted glass toward us.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">I tell the other kids about the Gulf of Mexico, where Aunty Mabel and Uncle Richard live. There were things waiting there in that warm flat water, crabs who'd clamp your toes no matter how carefully you stepped. Then I tell them about the beach in Monterey, where I was born, with all the wildflowers in the spring, and of course the seals.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=3>Marty and I get very tan, and Nai-nai scolds us. But she softens when she sees how hungry we are after our days at the beach, how we wolf everything down, no matter how strange. When we first got here we were picky, polite. Nai-nai corrected the way Marty held her chopsticks and made her cry. Our grandmother serves the meal in courses, unlike Ma; who sets everything down on the table at once.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Now we compromise. Marty is allowed to use a fork, and Nai-nai sometimes gives in to our pleas at the grocery store. One night she even makes hamburgers, following the recipe from Joy of Cooking, although we forget to get buns so we have to have them on toast. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=4>On the first rainy, Nai-nai climbs the stepladder and takes out boxes from the top shelf of her bedroom closed. They are filled with presents from her admirers, back in her youth when she was a lieder singer. She kept everything: dried sprays of orchids, brittle and black-edged; a collection of music boxes from Switzerland; perfume, never opened, the bottoms of the crystal flasks coated brown. I imagine the perfume to be like orange juice concentrate: if you added water it would be as good as fresh. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">She shows us photographs of our parents' wedding. "Handsome couple," she says. My mother doesn't look too different, except for more makeup and wavy hair, but my father is <font id=9>unrecognizable</font>. The man in the picture has dark, thick hair and a smooth, confident face, as if nothing bad had ever happened to him.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">My hair is long but I am not allowed to wear it loose except at night. Nai-nai washes it for me in the kitchen sink. I force myself to stand very still, although I get a crick in my neck and the water from the spray nozzle tickles.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Once, after my hair had dried enough to brush out, Nai-nai puts it up into a bun like hers. I watch her in the dresser mirror, trying to memorize the motions, butt my grandmother is too fast. When she's done she gives me the hand mirror so that I can examine the back of my head. I see that she has anchored the bun with a single pale green hairpin, like an arrow through a valetine.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"It's jade," my grandmother says, patting my shoulder. "You keep."</div>
