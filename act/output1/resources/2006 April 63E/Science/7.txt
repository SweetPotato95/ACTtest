<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The eccentricity of an ellipse describes its elongation; the more elongated the ellipse, the greater its eccentricity. The semimajor axis is half the length of the ellipse.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Perihelion (Angle θ=0°) is the point on the orbit closest to the Sun; aphelion (θ=180°) is the point on the orbit farthest from the Sun. The speed of a planet varies with θ. The speed of a planet versus θ is shown in Figure 2 for orbits with various eccentricities and semimajor axes.</div>

<div class = "quiz">38. A planet will escape from the solar system if its orbital speed is greater than the escape velocity. Based on the data in Figure 2, if the semimajor axis is 1.5×10<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2006 April 63E\imgs\135.png' width = '16'height = '42'/> km, the eccentricity is 0.10, and the escape velocity at perihelion is 44.2 km/sec, will the planet escape the solar system?
<div class = "choice">F. Yes, because the planet's orbital speed at perihelion is greater than the escape velocity.</div>
<div class = "choice">G. Yes, because the planet's orbital speed at perihelion is less than the escape velocity.</div>
<div class = "choice">H. No, because the planet's orbital speed at perihelion is greater than the escape velocity.</div>
