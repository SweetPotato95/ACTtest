<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In Zamia (a genus of seed plants), males have pollen-producing cones, and females have seed-producing cones. Pollination requires the movement of pollen from inside a male cone to inside a female cone, where multiple ovules are located and pollinated. The ovules then develop into seeds. Two students discuss the pollination process.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Student 1</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In Zamia, 90% of ovule pollination result from insect pollination; 10% result from wind pollination. No other pollination mechanism exists.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Zamia have mutualistic (mutually beneficial) relationships with insects. Weevils (a type of beetle) swarm male Zamia cones when these cones are releasing pollen. Upon entering the cones, the weevils become covered with the plant's sticky pollen. The weevils then visit the female Zamia cones. In the absence of weevils, the percent of ovule pollination in Zamia is about 10%.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Wind pollination is infrequent because Zamia pollen is large and heavy. Additionally, the openings into the female cones are aligned horizontally, so wind-borne pollen must be blown horizontally to enter these cones.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Student 2</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Wind pollination and insect pollination each cause 50% of pollination events in Zamia ovules. Without wind pollination, the percent of ovule pollination decreases by 50%. Likewise, without insect pollination, the percent of ovule pollination decreases by 50%. If neither of these processes occurs, the percent of ovule pollination decreases by 100%.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Wind tunnel experiments show that the shape of the female Zamia cones creates air currents that facilitate the horizontal movement of pollen into these cones. Additionally, male Zamia cones produce enormous quantities of pollen, a trait that is common only in wind-pollinated plants.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Experiments.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The students proposed 3 experiments using a natural Zamia population in an area with weevils and in which the percent of ovule pollination is normally 99% (se the table).</div>
