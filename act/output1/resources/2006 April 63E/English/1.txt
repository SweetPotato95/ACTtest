<h1>Amalia Hernández's Ballet Folkórico de Mexico</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Amalia Hernández bowed gracefully before the <font id=1>crowd, many</font> viewers stood and applauded, showing their appreciation for the performance they had just witnessed. Hernández didn't know it yet, but she and her Ballet Folklórico dancers had just won first prize at the 1961 Paris Festival of Nations. <font id=2>2</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Growing <font id=3>up, in Mexico in the 1920s</font> Hernández believed she was born to dance. Her father, a prominent rancher and politician, did not approve of his daughter exhibiting herself in such a manner. But Amalia was persistent. <font id=4>Despite this, </font> her father acquiesced, <font id=5>when he thought about it and gave in, </font> allowing, even helping, her to pursue her dream.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Senator Hernández built a dance studio and hired Europe's finest teachers to instruct Amalia <font id=6>in: classical</font> and modern ballet. The young woman relished the experience and excelled in her studies, but something wasn't right. <font id=7>7</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">So Amalia began studying under Mexican folklorist Luis Felipe Obregón. She learned that her <font id=8>countrys</font> folklore was a <font id=9>fusion</font> of Aztec, Mayan, Spanish, French, dutch and African influences. The songs and dances she cherished chronicled life, death, and <font id=10>to have a rebirth; </font> they celebrated creation and revolution; they celebrated the seasons and the harves. <font id=11>However, </font> Hernández decided to translate this lore into a new kind of ballet.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In 1952, she left a prestigious job at Mexico's Institute of Fine Arts to start her own dance company, the Ballet Folklórico de México. <font id=12>She immediately began to develop a program for her small troupe of dancers. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In 1954, Mexico's Department of Tourism made the Ballet Folklórico an official cultural ambassador. It has won hundreds of awards and toured over eighty countries, performing in a range of venues from the Greek Parthenon to New York's Radio City Music Hall.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Though Hernández died in 2000, her <font id=13>legacy: </font> the Ballet Folklórico-lives on, <font id=14>as an outstanding dance company. </font></div>
