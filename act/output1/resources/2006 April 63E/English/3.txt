<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Underwater explorer Jacques <font id=31>Cousteau, exploring under the sea, </font> predicted that one day humans would be "freed from the bondage of the surface" to work and even live underwater. In the 1960s, this became reality when the U.S. <font id=33>Navy deployed <font id=32>it's</font> first undersea habitat, SeaLab. </font></div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[2]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">An undersea habitat allowed divers to remain on the ocean floor for extended periods between dives. Because the pressure inside is matched to the pressure of the ocean depth <font id=34>outside, </font> divers can enter and exit at will without fear of decompression sickness-the dangerous bends. <font id=36>This ability extends the time that scientists can work <font id=35>greatly</font> underwater. </font> For example, at a <font id=37>depth of sixty feet. Work</font> would be limited to one hour per day if the dives had to start from the water <font id=38>surface, using SeaLab, </font> divers can work each day for as long as they desire.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[3]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Not long ago, the most advanced in a series of undersea habitats, Aquarius, was rested on the ocean floor in the Florida Keys. Bolted to a two-hundred-ton platform sixty-six feet below sea level at Conch Reef, <font id=39>scientists at this research outpost are offered</font> a unique opportunity to study the impact of pollution on coral reefs. <font id=40>40</font></div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[4]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Hidden under the waves, Aquarius is a bright yellow, forty-three-foot-long cylinder. Inside, scientists live in homey if cramped quarters, with bunks, a shower and toilet, a microwave, and <font id=41>an array</font> of scientific instruments. They can watch marine life through large portholes, and nter and exit their pressurized domicile through the <font id=42>moonpool, a</font> special air pocket that keeps the ocean outside.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=44> [1] At a depth of sicty-six feet, this decompression akes seventeen hours. [2] When the mission is complete and it is time for the aquanauts to return to land, the pressure inside the habitat must be <font id=43>gradual and</font> returned so that of sea level before divers can ascend. [3] A small price, Cousteau would likely have said, for being freed from the surface for so long. </font></div>
