<h1>The Birth of Broadcasting</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In the early 1900s, radio was not the widespread medium that it is today. Instead, <font id=16>its</font> use was limited to electronics buffs, many of whom built their own wireless sets, as radios were sometimes called in their infancy On his way to <font id=17>becoming, chairman of the board, </font> of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), <font id=18>the visionary David Sarnoff who saw a huge audience for radio. </font></div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">To create such an <font id=19>audience, Sarnoff believed</font> would require connecting citizens around the nation via radio to a dramatic large-scale <font id=20>popular</font> event with built-in mass appeal. Broadcasting this event from receivers set up in store windows, city parks, and other public spaces <font id=21>to</font> demonstrate that anyone could listen to the wireless; not just people with special skills and hard-to-build equipment.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The <font id=22>determinedly, ambitious</font> Sarnoff latched onto the perfect event. In 1921, he made elaborate plans to broadcast a heavyweight boxing match between American Jack Dempsey <font id=23>with</font> Frenchman Georges Carpentier. <font id=24>24</font> Sports enthusiasts around the world were anxiously awaiting the bout between the experienced Dempsey and the popular underdog, Carpentier. When the time came, <font id=25>a transmitter was borrowed</font> from the U.S. Navy and hired Major J. Andrew White to describe the <font id=26>action, at</font> RCA's request, store managers, theater owners, and municipal workers across the country set up loudspeakers.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The match took place in Jersey City on a hot July afternoon. While the athletes battled it out, Major White described the <font id=27>action from ringside. </font> All over the country, people listened in rapt attention. For the first time, they were hearing a distant event as it happened and sharing the experience with millions of others.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">During the fourth round, Dempsey defeated Carpentier, just as the Navy's overheated transmitter broke down into a molten mass of wires and tubes. No matter: RCA would soon be <font id=28>offering radios in return for money</font> to a public demanding broadcast music, sports, news, and weather. The era of electronic broadcasting had begun.</div>
