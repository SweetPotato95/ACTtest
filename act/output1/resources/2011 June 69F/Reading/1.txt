<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">PROSE FICTION: This passage s adapted from the novel Lily Nevada by Cecelia Holland (?1999 by Cecelia Holland).</div>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">By the time Brand got to the train station the Atlantic Mail was long gone. Brand stood staring up the empty tracks. The ordinary city noise of Reno settled around him, the wagons on the street, somebody whistling over by the livery stable. Turning, he went back across the platform and into the station house.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The agent was a fuzz-faced kid. Half a dozen locals sat along the benches by the woodstove; when Brand came into the waiting room they stirred and he heard his name spoken. He <font hidden id=3>(3.A)</font>leaned against the sill of the ticket window and said, "When's the next westbound train?"</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The agent didn't bother to lift his gaze to Brand "The next westbound passenger train will leave at five tonight"</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"I said when's the next train," Brand said, in a monotone.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The fuzzy face <font hidden id=3>(3.B)</font>turned toward him, alerted. "There's an express freight through in thirty minutes."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Brand said "I'll take that"</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"I can't sell tickets on a freight."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=7> "I'm not buying a ticket," </font> Brand said. He took the billfold from the inner pocket of his coat and hung his badge out in front of the kid's nose.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"Yes sir," the agent said briskly. "Thirty minutes."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Brand turned his head toward the woodstove. The men there were watching him mutely. He said, "Who wants to make a buck?"</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Immediately one stepped out from the middle of them. This was a pudgy man with thinning ham "I'll do it, Mr. Brand" he said.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"Go down to the telegraph office, have them wire the SP office in Truckee and hold the Mail for me. Sign it, 'Brand'"</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The pudgy man rushed off. The ticket agent said, <font id=8> "They don't hold the Mail for anything." </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Brand did not bother to answer. He went across the waiting room toward the stove. The other men watched him owlishly and he ignored them, pulled off his glove between his left arm and his side and held out his hand to warm in the heat of the stove. With the stump of his left arm he tucked the glove in to his pocket, and the stump after.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"Cold, for March," said one of the men tentatively.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Brand said nothing; it was bad enough to be recognized, it made him edgy when people knew him but he didn't know them. The pudgy man came back in, puffing. With a broad and sunny smile, he held out the receipt for the telegram and when Brand went to give him a dollar he shook his head.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"No, thanks, he said "Glad to have the chance to help."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Brand looked him over again. The man wore miner's clothes, denim pants and a flannel shirt and heavy workshoes. His thinning hair made him look old but he was not, younger than Brand, likely, who was thirty-two.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"My name's Billy Patch. If there's anything else I can do, I'd take it as a privilege, Mr. Brand."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=10>Brand gave him a sharp sideways look. He could not penetrate the man's eager smiling mask; maybe it wasn't a mask He said, "I'll remember that." </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The man crept around to the side, so that he was talking to Brand's face again. "I sort of follow yow career, in the papers, you know."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The men on the bench, who were listening with keen ears, rumbled up a burst of muted hilarity. Brand said, "I didn't know I had a career in the papers."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"Well you know, the police reports. The pudgy man <font hidden id=3>(3.C)</font>bobbed a little; his eyes shone. "I want to be a peace officer"</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Brand gave a laugh and lifted his gaze to the other man's face. "What for?"</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"Well, you know-." Bill Patch was rocking on his heels now, as if the inner urge to serve the law would not let him rest.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"Show it to him, Billy boy," one of the men on the bench hawled. "Go on."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The round face before Brand flushed red. With a murmur, the pudgy man took a folded magazine from his hip pocket.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=6> "Ned Buntline," Brand said, recognizing the style of the cover even before he could see the title. "What do you read that garbage for? That's not about anything-real."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The men by the stove bellowed with laughter. The pudgy man seemed to melt, his hand still stretched out toward Brand with the magazine. The hoots and jeers <font hidden id=3>(3.D)</font>washed over him; he lowered his gaze toward the floor. Brand watched steadily. It seemed like him standing there, and the other boys jeering, "Stumpy!"</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"I need a deputy, maybe, on this case I'm on now. Want the job? Just for a day or so." </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The pudgy man's gaze snapped back up. The color faded out of his cheeks. The raucous voices of the other men died away. The pudgy man said, "Would I!"</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"Just come along. Give me a hand if I need it. This is probably a wild-goose chase anyway."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"Yes, sir!"</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Brand turned away a little now, too late, wishing he had kept his mouth shut. He wondered why he had saddled himself with this stranger. "Well," he said. "Come on, then."</div>
