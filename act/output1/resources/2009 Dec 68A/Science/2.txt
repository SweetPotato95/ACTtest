<div class = "quiz">6. Assume that a subject's attractiveness to mosquitoes depends on body temperature. Based on Figure 4, the body temperature of which of the following Group Z subjects, with which treatment status, was most attractive to mosquitoes?

<div class = "choice">B. Yes; on average, more mosquitoes were attracted to subjects from Group Z than to subjects from Group X or Y.</div>
<div class = "choice">C. No; on average, more mosquitoes were attracted to subjects from Group X than to subjects from Group Y or Z.</div>

<div class = "quiz">9. Which of the following is the most likely reason that subjects infected with gametocytes were tested both before and after their infections were cured?

<div class = "quiz">10. In Studies 1 and 2, which group-Group X or Group Y-more likely served as the standard of comparison allowing the researchers to compare the results for Group Z from Study 1 to the results for Group Z from Study 2?
<div class = "choice">F. Group X, because the infection status of the Group X subjects was different in Study 1 and Study 2.</div>
