<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The following paragraphs may or may not be in the most logical order. Each-paragraph is numbered in brackets, and question 59 will ask you to choose where Paragraph 4 should most logically be placed.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[1]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">It was <font id=46>1948. A</font> humanitarian and political drama of lasting importance was about to <font id=47>unfold</font> under the homely name "Operation Vittles." <font id=48>48</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[2]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Since the end of World War II three years earlier, the victorious Allies had divided defeated Germany into four sectors. The United States, Great Britain, and France had combined their portions into West <font id=49>Germany, while the Soviet Union</font> had installed a separate government in East Germany.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[3]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=50>Berlin-the capital of Germany, </font> was similarly divided into four sectors. However, the <font id=51>city's location</font> deep inside East Germany gave a strategic advantage to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, who wanted control over the entire city, not just the one Soviet sector. Stalin <font id=52>planned to use a tactic of warfare dating back to medieval times</font>. He cut off all ground access into West Berlin-the part of the city he did not already control. Threatening to starve the 2.5 million residents of West <font id=53>Berlin he thought, </font> might force the other three countries to cede the whole city to him.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[4]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Stalin's siege might have been successful in an era of castles and knights. But this was the aeronautical age, and Stalin's antagonists <font id=54>on ground transportation</font> did not have to rely to move food and supplies into West Berlin. <font id=57>What resulted from this siege was one of the largest humanitarian efforts to <font id=55>date pilots</font> who had bombed Berlin <font id=56>relentless</font> during the war were now called upon to deliver food-"vittles"-as part of the Berlin Airlift. </font> "Operation Vittles" needed to operate around the clock, with a C-54 aircraft landing in Berlin every three minutes to keep the residents from starving. About 3,500 tons of food, medical supplies, and fuel arrived at Tempelhof Airfield daily.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[5]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The Soviets tried to thwart the operation by <font id=58>bugging and harassing</font> pilots with blinding spotlights, near misses by Soviet planes, and radio interference. These tactics failed. After fifteen months, Stalin relented, the roads to West Berlin were reopened, and "Operation Vittles"' came to a successful conclusion.</div>
