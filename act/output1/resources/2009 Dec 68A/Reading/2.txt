<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article "The Social Life of Paper" by Malcolm Gladwell (?2002 by The Conde Nast Publications).</div>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Computer technology was supposed to replace paper. But that hasn't happened. Every country in the Western world uses more paper today, on a per-capita basis, than it did ten years ago. The consumption of uncoated free-sheet paper, for instance-the most common kind of office paper-rose almost fifteen per cent in the United States between 1995 and 2000. This is generally taken as evidence of how hard it is to eradicate old, wasteful habits and of how stubbornly resistant we are to the efficiencies offered by computerization. A number of cognitive psychologists and ergonomic experts, however, don't agree. Paper has persisted, they argue, for very good reasons: when it comes to performing certain kinds of cognitive tasks, paper has many advantages over computers.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The case for paper is made most eloquently in The Myth of the Paperless Office, by two social scientists, Abigail Sellen and Richard Harper. They begin their book with an account of a study they conducted at the International Monetary Fund, in Washington, D.C. Economists at the IMF spend most of their time writing reports on complicated economic questions, work that would seem to be perfectly suited to sitting in front of a computer. Nonetheless, the IMF is <font id=19>awash</font> in paper, and Sellen and Harper wanted to find out why. Their answer is that the business of writing reports-at least at the IMF-is an intensely collaborative process, involving the professional judgments and contributions of many people. <font id=18>The economists bring drafts of reports to conference rooms, spread out the relevant pages, and negotiate changes with one another. They go back to their offices and jot down comments in the margin, taking advantage of the freedom offered by the informality of the handwritten note. Then they deliver the annotated draft to the author in person, taking him or her, page by page, through the suggested changes. At the end of the process, the author spreads out all the pages with comments on a desk and starts to enter them on the computer-moving the pages around, organizing and reorganizing, saving and discarding. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Without paper, this kind of collaborative, iterative work process would be much more difficult. According to Sellen and Harper, paper has a unique set of "affordances"-that is, qualities that permit specific kinds of uses. Paper is tangible: we can pick up a document, flip through it, read little bits here and there, and quickly get a sense of it. Paper is spatially flexible, meaning that we can spread it out and arrange it in the way that suits us best. And it's tailorable: we can easily annotate it, and scribble on it as we read, without altering the original text. Digital documents, of course, have their own affordances. They can be easily searched, shared, stored, accessed remotely, and linked to other relevant material. But they lack the affordances that really matter to a group of people working together on a report.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Paper enables a certain kind of thinking. What covers many desks are piles of paper-journals, magazines, binders, postcards, videotapes, and all the other artifacts of the knowledge economy. When a group at a leading computer company studied piling behavior several years ago, they found that even the most disorderly piles usually make perfect sense to the piler. Over time, piles get broken down and resorted, sometimes chronologically and thematically; clues about certain documents may be physically embedded in the file by, say, stacking a certain piece of paper at an angle or inserting dividers into the stack.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">But why do we pile documents instead of filing them? Because piles represent the process of active, ongoing thinking. The psychologist Alison Kidd, whose research Sellen and Harper refer to extensively, argues that "knowledge workers" use the physical space of the desktop to hold "ideas which they cannot yet categorize or even decide how they might use." The messy desk is not necessarily a sign of disorganization. It may be a sign of complexity: those who deal with many unresolved ideas simultaneously cannot sort and file the papers on their desks, because they haven't yet sorted and filed the ideas in their head. Kidd writes that many of the people she talked to use the papers on their desks as contextual cues to "recover a complex set of threads without difficulty and delay" when they come in on a Monday morning, or after their work has been interrupted by a phone call. What we see when we look at the piles on our desks is, in a sense, the contents of our brains.</div>
