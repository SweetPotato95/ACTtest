The sphere is in free fall between Points B and C and first hits the floor at Point C, a horizontal distance X from the bottom of the inclined plane.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Figure 2 shows how X varies with θ for different H if the sphere rolls from Point A to Point B. Figure 3 shows how X varies with θ for different H if the sphere slides from Point A to Point B.</div>
