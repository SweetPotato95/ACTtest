<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">It is entirely possible, right now, to make a delicious French fry that does not carry with it a death sentence. A French fry can be much more than a delivery vehicle for fat.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Is it really that simple, though? Consider the cautionary tale of the efforts of a group of food scientists at Auburn University more than a decade ago to come up with a better hamburger. The Auburn team wanted to create a leaner beef that tasted as good as regular ground beef. They couldn't just remove the fat, because .that would leave the meat dry and mealy. They wanted to replace the fat. The goal of the Auburn scientists was to cut about two-thirds of the fat from normal ground beef, which meant that they needed to find something to add to the beef that would hold an equivalent amount of water-and continue to retain that water even as the beef was being grilled. Their choice? Seaweed, or, more precisely, carrageenan. They also selected some basic flavor enhancers, designed to make up for the lost fat "taste." The result was a beef patty that was roughly three-quarters water, twenty per cent protein, five per cent or so fat, and a quarter of a per cent seaweed. They called it AU Lean.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">It didn't take the Auburn scientists long to realize that they had created something special. They began doing blind taste comparisons of AU Lean burgers and .traditional twenty-per-cent-fat burgers. Time after time, the AU Lean burgers won. <font id=12>Next, they took their invention into the field. They recruited a hundred families and supplied them with three kinds of ground beef for home cooking over consecutive three-week intervals- regular "market" ground-beef with twenty per cent fat, ground beef, with five per cent fat, and AU Lean. The families were asked to rate the different kinds of beef, without knowing which was which. Again, the AU Lean won hands down.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=20>What the Auburn team showed was that, even though people love the taste and feel of fat-and naturally gravitate toward high-fat food-they can be fooled into thinking there is a lot of fat in something when there isn't. When the group tried to lower the fat in AU Lean below five per cent, people didn't like it anymore. But, within the relatively broad range of between five and twenty-five per cent, you can add water, and some flavoring and most people can't tell the difference.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">What's more, people appear to be more sensitive to the volume of food they consume than to its calorie content. Barbara Rolls, a nutritionist at Penn State, has demonstrated this principle with satiety studies. She feeds one group of people a high-volume snack and another group a low-volume snack. Even though the two snacks have the same calorie count, she finds that people who eat the high-volume snack feel more satisfied. Eating AU Lean, in short, isn't going to leave you with a craving for more calories; you'll feel just as full.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">For anyone looking to improve the quality of fast food, all this is heartening news. It means that you should be able to put low-fat cheese and low-fat mayonnaise in a fast-food hamburger without anyone's complaining. <font id=13>It also means that there's no particular reason to use twenty-per-cent-fat ground beef, in a fast- food burger.</font> In 1990, using just this argument, the Auburn team suggested to McDonald's that it make a hamburger out of AU Lean. Shortly thereafter, McDonald's came out with the McLean Deluxe. Other fast-food houses scrambled to follow suit. Nutritionists were delighted. And fast food appeared on the verge of a revolution.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Only, it wasn't. The McLean was a flop, and four years later it was off the market. What happened? Part of the problem appears to have been that McDonald's rushed the burger to market before many of the production kinks had been worked out. More important, though, was the psychological handicap the burger faced. People liked AU Lean in blind taste tests because they didn't know it was AU Lean; they were fooled into thinking it was regular ground beef. But nobody was fooled when it came to the McLean Deluxe. It was sold as the healthy choice-<font id=17>and who goes to McDonald's for health food?</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">This is sobering news for those interested in improving the American diet. For years, the nutrition movement in this country has' made transparency one of its principal goals: it has assumed that the best way to help people improve their diets is to tell them precisely what's in their food, to label certain foods good and certain foods bad. But transparency can backfire, because sometimes nothing is more deadly for our taste buds than the knowledge that what we are eating is good for us.</div>
