<h1>Swimming in Open Water</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Immersed in the icy water off the Antarctic Peninsula, Lynne Cox wasn't sure if she could accomplish her goal to be the first person to swim a mile through the glacier- strewn sea. At forty-five, she <font id=46>would of</font> been training for two years for this event, <font id=47>which</font> she hoped her preparations would pay off.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Cox grew up swimming in the and Maine. When she was fifteen, she broke the men's and women's 49 record's for swimming the English Channel by finishing the twenty-seven-mile swim in less than ten hours.<font id=50>50</font>She <font id=51>could swim</font> in open water and had swum across the Cook Strait in New Zealand, around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, and across Lake Titicaca from Bolivia to Peru.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=53>[1] Cox is fortunate that she has a natural tolerance for cold temperatures, but swimming the Antarctic-in water only slightly above freezing-demanded serious preparation. [2] This athlete studied how Antarctic animals adapt to the frigid environment. [3] Penguins' double layer of feathers acts as insulation, so she grew her hair long and piled it under her swim cap. [4] Antarctic seals rely on body fat for warmth, so Cox gained twelve pounds, <font id=52>it was weight</font> that she hoped would keep her warm in the icy water.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In November 2002, <font id=54>a crew of</font> physicians, sailors, and expedition experts, Cox headed for Neko Harbor on the Antarctic Peninsula. There she dove into water chilled by melting glaciers and began to swim. <font id=55>Without proper training, she would have been in peril.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Her initial <font id=56>fatigue and exhaustion</font> turned into exhilaration as she moved through water that was clearer and <font id=57>blue as</font> any she'd swum in before. For a moment at the end, she considered going even farther. Cox knew, however, that the longer she stayed in the water, the longer it, would take to bring her body temperature-which fell to 95.5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the swim-<font id=58> back to normal.</font> A mile was good <font id=59>enough as</font> Cox closed in on the shore-and her goal-<font id=60>penguins splashed in the water with the great athlete.</font></div>
