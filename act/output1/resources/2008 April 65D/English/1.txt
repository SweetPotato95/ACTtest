<h1>The Hunt for Morel Mushrooms</h1>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[1] When I close ray eyes I see them. They pop up through dead leaves, emerge from under fallen logs, and sprout next to tree stumps. Even indoors, I think I spot them out of the corner of my eye. Basically, I spend <font id=1>every free moment</font> in search of them. .</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[2] I'm not talking <font id=2>about imaginary creatures but</font> about deliciously real morel mushrooms- <font id=3>funny-looking, textured, edible</font> fungi that appear in springtime. These homely ground dwellers inspire, their fans to search the woods for hours, intent on finding enough to fry up for dinner. Would it be easier to buy mushrooms at the store? Absolutely. But it wouldn't be as .much fun. Once you find your first morel, maybe by a dead elm or in an old apple orchard, <font id=4>a person</font> will be even more determined to find the next one. And the next. And so on.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[3] Like many morel hunters, I learned from an expert. She invited me along to see firsthand how it's done. I learned even more by reading <font id=5>reputable, detailed field guides about wild mushrooms.</font> That's a crucial part of the preparation <font id=6>to get ready</font> for morel hunting, because often the same woods that yield morels produce poisonous mushrooms, too.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[4] <font id=7>7</font>Every spring, there's a contest where I live in northern Minnesota to see who can. find the most <font id=8>morels, this</font> year, I'm going to enter. Last year, one participant found over 3,000 <font id=9> morels becoming my</font> hero. And he's willing to talk with me about this hobby we are both passionate about. Luckily, I know what question not to ask. You never ask morel hunters where they made their biggest find. Keeping <font id=10>silent about your favorite spots,</font> is part of the mystique of this glorious pastime.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[5] Mostly, finding morels requires <font id=11>two things in particular.</font> Smaller and <font id=12>paler then</font> the average pinecone, a morel blends perfectly into <font id=13>its</font> natural surroundings. <font id=14>However, you</font> can look right at one and not see it. Morels fool everyone, even the <font id=15>experts, that's</font> probably why the saying goes that the best place to look for morels is directly behind you.</div>
