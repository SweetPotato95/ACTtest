<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">When a substance is dissolved in a solvent, the freezing and boiling points of the solution will differ from those of the pure solvent. These changes depend on the concentration of solute particles in the solution. Figures 1 and 2 show how the freezing point and the boiling point, respectively, of <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2007 Dec 65E\imgs\178.png' width = '54'height = '38'/> at 1 atm of pressure vary with concentration</div>
