<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The following paragraphs may or may not be in the most logical order. Each paragraph is numbered in brackets, and question 59 will ask you to choose where Paragraph 5 should most logically be placed.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In November 1959, when jazz musician Ornette Coleman arrived in New York City with saxophone in hand, the civil rights movement was about to shift into high gear. For many African Americans, the <font id=46>word, freedom</font> would serve as a goal, a guiding principle, and a rallying cry.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[2]</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Qrnette Coleman had something new to offer. He had <font id=47>lonely</font> developed an unorthodox approach over years of effort, first in his home state of Texas and then in Los Angeles, where he was routinely snubbed by older musicians <font id=48>48</font>. Coleman's approach <font id=49>involved</font> improvisation guided by a personal expression of emotions and a freedom from fixed harmonic chord structures and tempos.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[3]</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Eventually, his style <font id=50>caught</font> the attention of other adventurous young players- In 1958, Coleman was given the opportunity to record, and the resulting album-Something Else!-served notice that a true innovator was on the scene.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[4]</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Next came Coleman's <font id=51>controversial, but successful</font> 1959 debut with his quartet at a New York club called the Five Spot: This engagement-coupled <font id=52>for</font> the release of two more albums (The Shape of Jazz to Come and The Change of the Century)¬-<font id=53>which reversed</font> Coleman's fortunes. <font id=54>Some musicians were concerned that his influence would ruin jazz.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[5]</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">As a uniquely African American musical form, jazz <font id=55>seemed</font> poised to play <font id=56>in the struggle</font> a role for freedom and equality. But many people felt that jazz was stagnating. Rock'n' roll had become the most popular music of the era. and no major wave of inspiration had swept through jazz since the bebop revolution of the early forties.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[6]</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Free <font id=57>jazz, as Coleman's style came to be known,</font> provided an unconstrained sound to match the intensity and conviction of the times. This fusion of a new sound with a new activist spirit can be heard in many recordings of the early sixties, notably those of Sonny Rollins, Abbey Lincoln, and Charles Mingus. Yet, it was Ornette Coleman, through his determination and uncompromising individuality, who spearheaded <font id=58>this.</font></div>
