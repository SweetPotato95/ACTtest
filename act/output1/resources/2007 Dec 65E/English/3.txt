<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Dr. Esther Afua <font id=31>Ocloo:</font> first chairwoman of women's World Banking, preferred to be called Auntie <font id=32>Ocloo.</font> "Auntie" is a traditional title of respect in the African nation of Ghana, her native land.

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Ocloo knew that <font id=33>her countrywomen</font> would need to have'a steady source of <font id=34>income. In</font> order to gain access to education and health care. So, at the 1975 Mexico City gathering that opened the United Nations Decade for Women, Ocloo, with like-minded women, <font id=35>will have developed</font> a "microlending" plan. Here's how it works: A large lending institution lends the initial money to a microlending institution, <font id=36>$5 million or more.</font> Then the microlending institution, such as Women's World Banking. makes a small loan (as little as $50) to, <font id=37>in contrast,</font> an artisan or a food vendor <font id=38>whom</font> would not qualify for a loan from a commercial bank. <font id=39>After</font> the business grows and the loan is repaid, the microlender makes a larger loan available.</div>
