<h1>The Geese of Horicon Marsh</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">One Sunday morning in September, I convinced several friends to accompany me to a wildlife preserve famous for the remarkable number of Canada geese that stop <font id=16>during their annual migration</font> there. This preserve, Horicon Marsh, is located in southeast Wisconsin, just a three-hour drive from my home.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">I hadn't been to Horicon Marsh in a few years, but my memories of visiting the preserve were still <font id=17>vivid.</font> Often, when I feel a need <font id=18>within myself to have a tranquil moment,</font> I try to summon images of the tall grasses and furry cattails and the mallards, herons, and geese <font id=19>whom are found</font> in the 32,000-acre marsh. <font id=10>Thinking about the geese is always especially comforting. </font>Their sheer number-thousands upon thousands of them coming down from Hudson Bay in Canada-<font id=21>are</font> astonishing.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The sound of the distant honking of these majestic <font id=22>birds</font> always makes me look up. <font id=23>Therefore,</font> I'm moved by the timbre of their voices and the romantic notion that they get the urge to travel when the seasons change. I've always felt that the migration of the Canada geese symbolizes the arrival of fall, <font id=24>which is the favorite season of many people.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">As my friends and I drove to Horicon Marsh that cool morning. I suddenly recalled a trip from my childhood. I recalled sitting in the back seat of our station wagon, looking out in awe at all the geese. My mother was saying, "Look how close they are!" and my father was turning his face toward the slate gray sky in wonder. The V-shaped skein of geese was so large that it seemed to <font id=25>stretch across the sky.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">That memory was in my mind during the drive to Horicon Marsh. When my friends and I got to the marsh, we wandered <font id=26>around.</font> We trained our binoculars on the white <font id=27>herons</font> laughed at the frolicking mallards, and could not get over the huge flocks of geese. <font id=28>28</font> <font id=29>Standing</font> on the edge of the marsh at early evening. we watched a perfectly formed V of geese approach, fly low overhead, and then continue to the other side of the marsh. I can hear the beating of their wings and <font id=30>their mournful honking even now.</font></div>
