<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">During World War II, millions of women took industrial jobs in shipyards, aircraft plants, steel mills, and other defense-related enterprises throughout the United States. The labor force that <font id=61>shrank and decreased</font> as men joined the military forces <font id=62>but</font> grew as women flooded into jobs newly open to them. Crucial to the war effort, these women were immortalized by a fictional poster character of the era: Rosie the Riveter. <font id=64>Her strong arms, direct gaze, <font id=63>weating</font> rugged work clothes convey the competence and determination that so many women brought with them into their new roles.</font></div>

A 441-foot-long walkway, representing the keel of a Liberty Ship, <font id=70>has lead</font> to a platform that commands a view of San Francisco Bay. Sculptures inspired by elements of the ships <font id=71>can also be seen.</font> Panels positioned among the sculptures display photographs, letters, welding certificates, and other "Rosie" artifacts.</div>

The scars on her arms from welding sparks are visible reminders of the hard labor she performed.</div>
