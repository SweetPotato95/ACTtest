<h1>Fragile Contents</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The book arrived in a disappointing package. It was small and narrow, wrapped in plain brown paper. My mother's faint <font id=1>handwriting</font> covered the outside. Fragile, she <font id=2>writes</font> next to my address and along each of the <font id=3>sides</font>, I wasn't sure, for a moment. whether she meant to warn the postal workers or me. We had waited years for the publication of this <font id=4>book</font> there were very few copies. It had taken months for me to convince my mother to send me hers. The contents of this package were indeed <font id=5>fragile, I thought,</font> but not in any of the expected ways.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">It was a handbook of the Miami <font id=6>language. Published</font> by the Miami Nation of Oklahoma.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=7>It seemed too small, too light, to contain the building blocks of an entire language, one that had lain dormant for me for over thirty years.</font> In fact, only a few of the oldest members of the tribe remember speaking the language at all. I had expected something larger and heavier, as substantial as my webster's Dictionary. <font id=8>A folded note from my mother was tucked between the pages.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">I <font id=9>glanced and looked</font> through the pages. Then I read about the different parts of speech, about Miami vowels and consonants. However, it was when I began pronouncing the words to <font id=10>myself;</font> that I felt the true weight of the book. As I spoke, I was immediately overwhelmed with images of my great-grandfather. I remembered the way he <font id=11>is used to</font> read to me when I was very young. He would point to the pictures in my <font id=12>storybooks, and</font> giving things their Miami names. I remembered him pointing to a tree. a cloud, a dog. and naming them in the Miami language. giving them back to me in the <font id=13>language of his own childhood.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">After he died, it was a language I never heard again-<font id=14>nonetheless</font>, until I heard myself struggling with the words he <font id=15>would use</font> so easily all those years ago, his voice coming back as vividly as if he were next to me once again, pointing to the page, guiding me.</div>
