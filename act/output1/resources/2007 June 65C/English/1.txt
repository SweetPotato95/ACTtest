<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Before I left home to attend college, my grandmother gave me a bag filled with old photographic negatives. Having enrolled in a photography class for my first semester, I had offered to preserve some of out family's <font id=1>memories before the film</font> deteriorated or got lost. My grandmother patted my hand and said, "Good luck, Angela."</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[2]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=6>[1] I soon came to love the silence of the photo darkroom, <font id=2>illuminated only by its dim, red safelight.</font> [2] Something about that <font id=3>isolation, and darkness</font> seemed mysterious. [3] I took a negative from the <font id=4>collection and enclosed</font> it in the glass of the enlarger. [4] An enlarger is a magnifying device used in printing photographs. [5] I exposed the paper with a flash of light through the negative and then placed the paper in a developing solution. [6] Soon, the <font id=5>faces' of my mother's</font> family began to appear on the paper.</font></div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[3]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Early in the semester, I opened the bag of battered negatives and <font id=7>began</font> to examine them. "I don't know." I told my grandmother doubtfully; over the phone, "but I'll see what I can do." Some of the negatives were not much larger. than postage stamps, while others were as large as greeting cards. Holding them up to the light, I could scarcely make out traces of faint figures. Many of the negatives were bent and faded, and some were speckled with age spots.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[4]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=12>In one shot, my young grandparents toted crates filled with ripe fruit, and my mother sat on a <font id=8> branch, peering</font> down at the camera. They floated before me, not like ancestral ghosts but physical and alive. <font id=9>Yet, all</font> my mother's stories came to mind.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">I recalled her description of the <font id=10>long hard hours</font>, spent working in the migrant camps and the peach and apricot fuzz that prickled <font id=11>it's</font> skin.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[5]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In the darkroom that first semester of college, <font id=13>far from home</font>, I studied these scenes from the lives of my relatives. Whenever I felt discouraged, those photographs would reassure me. Though the distance in time and space between us was great, I knew that as long as I had those photographs, my family could never be far away.</div>
