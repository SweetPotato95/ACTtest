<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">﻿Students studied the photodecomposition (breakdown by light) of p-nitrophenol (a toxic pollutant) in wastewater. They measured the concentration of p-nitrophenol (in parts per million. ppm) in wastewater samples during exposure to various lighting conditions. Titanium dioxide (<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2007 June 65C\imgs\228.png' width = '55'height = '38'/>) and/or hydrogen peroxide (<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2007 June 65C\imgs\229.png' width = '61'height = '38'/>) were added to some samples at the start of exposure (time = 0 min). <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2007 June 65C\imgs\230.png' width = '55'height = '38'/>and <img src='file:\$$$\resources\2007 June 65C\imgs\231.png' width = '61'height = '38'/> composition reactions.
