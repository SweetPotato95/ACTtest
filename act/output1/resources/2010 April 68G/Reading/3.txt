<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from the memoir My Heart is in the Earth: True Stories of Alabama and Mexico by Wayne Greenshaw (â—‹c200l by Wayne Greenshaw).</div>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Hank Williams was a popular singer and writer of country music in the 1940s and 50s.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In the summertimes of my youth, my younger brother, Donnie Lee, and I rode with Daddy, a traveling salesman: when he traveled Alabama and east Mississippi, stopping at barber and beauty shops, bringing them the latest stainless steel razors, smelly perfumed wave lotion, the fanciest new dryers, and a tonic that would plaster hair to the scalp while turning it dark brown.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">It was on a highway in south Alabama that we were passed one afternoon by a pink Cadillac with a pair of cowboy boots sticking out the rear window. "That's ol' Hank," Daddy said.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Donnie Lee and I looked at each other, puzzled.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"In a minute or two there'll be another one just is like that," Daddy said.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Donnie Lee questioned his statement.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">But, sure enough, in a few minutes, the first car's twin, down to the snazzy fins shining brightly in the sunlight, passed us with a beep of its horn. Daddy answered and shot an abbreviated wave.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In the next town we found the two Cadillacs parked side by side facing the curb outside the drugstore. Daddy pulled his car parallel to them. We followed him inside, where a skinny man wearing a white cowboy hat rose from the table where he sat with three friends and, grinning from ear to ear, greeted Daddy like a long lost relative. They hugged and carried on, Daddy introducing us as his "number one assistants," and told us, "Boys, this is Hank Williams, the most famous singer and songwriter ever to come out of Georgiana."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The skinny man hooted. "Now, that's about the best introduction I've ever had," he said, and ordered a round of soft drinks, which we accepted with thanks. We slunk back on the edge of the shallow breeze from the slow moving fan centered over the marble-topped table. In the shadows of glass-squared display booths we sipped our drinks where the men talked about "the road," Daddy asking where they'd played, Hank and his boys saying they'd had a big crowd down in Andalusia the night before.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">With his bladed face cocked just so, the shadow of his wide-brimmed hat muting his features, Hank caught my eye and grinned and said, "What kind-a music you like, big 'un?" and I tried to hide behind my glass of soda, pushing back shyly against the glass case. "Cat got yo' tongue?" he asked, and I put my mouth to the edge of the cold glass to keep from saying anything, feeling the heat of all their eyes on me. I wished we'd never seen the Cadillacs or the men, and I wondered when Daddy was going to take us on down the road, where he said he had more shops to call on.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">When I finally did glance up, I looked directly into the bluest eyes I'd ever seen on a man. His thin mouth stretched into a generous smile. "How's about you boys coming out here to the car with me?" He pushed his chair back. "I got some things for y'all."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">From the trunk of one of the pink Cadillacs he took two black-and-white eight-by-ten glossy photographs of himself, scratched out, "For Wayne, a fine young man," and signed it, then did the same for Donnie Lee. As we moved to Daddy's car, he called, "You got a Victrola?" I nodded. Then be handed me a half-dozen 78 rpm records. "Y' all share 'em, okay?" I nodded.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">When we returned home to Trussville on Friday, Mama questioned us about our week with Daddy. We showed her the photographs. We took the records to our room. As the first started to play, Donnie Lee made a face. I frowned and shook my head.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In memory, that trip with Daddy <font id=27>unwinds</font> in shades of black-and-white colored with a streak of pink. <font id=28>Today, as I listen to the powerful poetic slur of his music, hitting notes that even he could not find on <font hidden id=26>(26.A)</font>a scale between five parallel lines, sounding words that ring against the heart like <font hidden id=26>(26.B)</font>coins dropped into a deep clear pool at the bottom of a deep dark cave, I am so moved that I am stunned almost senseless with its beauty.</font> Somewhere between then and now I learned to fathom the depths of his genius.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"Did you hear <font hidden id=26>(26.C)</font>that lonesome whippoorwill? He sounds too blue to fly. <font hidden id=26>(26.D)</font>The midnight train is whining low. I'm so Lonesome I could cry."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">How could any eleven-year-old ever k now the naked strength of such words prayed to such sounds? The plaintive voice cuts to the heart that knows the secrets of being twisted and torn, battered and bruised, where the scar-tissue grates against old feelings that cannot-will not-remain hidden.</div>
