<h1>Coming to America</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Though it was fifteen years ago, I still remember my journey from China to the United States when I was seven years old. On the tarmac outside the crowded airport in Shanghai, I mustered the last of my feigned courage to wave goodbye to my grandparents and boarded the plane. The plane taxied a long way, then quickly sped up, gave a sudden jolt, and lifted off.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=15>Seeing dark storm clouds ahead,</font> drops of rain began to streak my window. Feeling so much force. against me, I shut my eyes in search of familiar memories <font id=16>I would recognize.</font> I called up visions of Grandma singing lullabies to me, of delicious meals at the Spring and Autumn festivals, and of my schoolmates walking with me to school.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=17>I was traveling from my home in Shanghai to New York City.</font> I was to join my parents, who had gone to pursue graduate degrees <font id=18>to the United States</font> when I was just three. But I was quite nervous about living with these people <font id=19>whom I could barely remember.</font> Suddenly I felt empty, acutely aware that I was leaving the only home I'd ever <font id=20>known.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">As the plane gained <font id=21>altitude and the</font> dark storm clouds <font id=22>have given</font> way to a deep blue sky. Images of home quickly filled that blue void. I saw myself blowing out candles at my <font id=23>grandparents</font> table on my seventh birthday. We <font id=24>made do with</font> dumplings. duck, and a small white cake. I can still picture the two beaming faces across the table-Grandpa with his knowing grin and Grandma with her plump cheeks dimpling as she <font id=25>smiled both</font> congratulating me on my good fortune of going to live in the United States. <font id=26>26</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Twenty-four hours after leaving Shanghai, I finally got off the plane in New York. A <font id=27>woman recognized me</font> from pictures as my mother rushed toward me, wrapped me in her arms, and gently spun around with me. I immediately felt <font id=28>safe and at home in</font> her arms.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Now, as I reflect on that fateful trip, I am proud of the bravery of that little boy who left the security of his childhood home for a new life. <font id=29>29</font></div>
