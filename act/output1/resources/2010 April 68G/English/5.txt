<h1>Barbara McClintock and the Genetics of Maize</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">As a leader in the field of genetics, Barbara McClintock <font id=60>of human genes</font> made significant steps in unraveling the mysteries. <font id=62>When she began studies in the 1920s, scientists <font id=61>had only recently began</font> to consider genetics a field of study and accept the research of Gregor Mendel (1822-1884).</font> His theory stated that plants resembled their "parents" in a predictable <font id=63>manner based</font> on laws of inheritance. <font id=64>However, McClintock's research pushed the field of genetics beyond Mendel's principles.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">McClintock believed maize (corn) was <font id=65>idealistically a</font> plant to study because each ear had hundreds of <font id=66>kernels for</font> each with a different set of chromosomes. The first to perfect a staining technique for distinguishing the individual chromosomes of <font id=67>maize.</font> McClintock studied the way genes were arranged on these chromosomes. By 1951, she had studied many generations of maize, noting the locations of groups of genes as the plants reproduced.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">McClintock found that some of the maize kernels were striped or <font id=68>spotted rather, then</font> the uniform color found in the parent plants. <font id=69>For example, these</font> findings were in marked contrast to Mendel's work, which had concluded that the kernel color of offspring could be predicted from the combination of genes inherited from the parent plants. In the multicolored kernels, McClintock discovered that specialized genes, later called transposons, were changing positions on and between the chromosomes. These changes caused a deviation from the <font id=70>kernel color of the maize that would have been anticipated by scientists.</font> McClintock named this genetic phenomenon transposition.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">McClintock's work was far ahead of the other genetic research of her time. It took the scientific community over thirty years to <font id=71>understand</font> and publicly recognize her discoveries. In other scientific fields, the concept of transposition <font id=72>may</font> had wide-ranging applications, <font id=73>and</font> in the development of medical treatments for bacterial infections and cancer. After the importance of her research <font id=74>gained appreciation for its value,</font> she <font id=75>was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1983.</font></div>
