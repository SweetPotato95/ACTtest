<h1>Weimaraner Whimsy</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">While the story of Cinderella has been depicted countless times, few of its lead actresses are as fetching as the young heroine of Fay 's Fairy Tales. A cascade of blonde curls covers her shoulders, thick lashes frame soulful dark eyes, and her moist nose <font id=1>glisten</font> appealingly at the end of a long snout.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=5>Moist nose? Snout? Of course, for this Cinderella was photographed by William Wegman, an artist who has raised dog photography <font id=2>for</font> the level of art. His photographs of  Weimaraners have gained him <font id=3>international acclaim</font> and made his <font id=4>pets, the best-known dogs,</font> since Lassie and Rin Tin Tin.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Wegman came to the attention of the art world in 1970 with his portraits of his dog Man Ray, the first of Wegman's Weimaraners to pose for photos. The photographer was fascinated by the neutral gray of the dog's coat and his willingness to pose while wearing different costumes. Wegman's photos of Man Ray grew in popularity. <font id=6>In 1982 the dog was named "Man of the Year" by the New York newspaper The Village Voice.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=11><font id=7>Later,</font> other Weimaraners became part of the Wegman family, giving him additional subjects for his photos. <font id=8>Each has a unique personality that Wegman considers Carefully before deciding what sorts of pictures to take.</font> [A] Chundo is eager to work, but he doesn't sit still very long. [B] Batty, who often falls asleep while posing, has a sweet and dreamy quality. [C] And Fay <font id=9>Looked</font> great in wigs, which makes her a natural choice to portray female characters. [D] While Wegman's reputation was made with art photography, in recent years his children's books have generated a new but equally devoted following. His whimsical style appeals to children, <font id=10>having chosen</font> toreenact familiar fairy tales with canine characters.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=12>With a keen eye for art,</font> Wegman's Weimaraners lead an ordinary dog's life in <font id=13>most</font> ways. The breed is sociable and intelligent, and Wegman reports that the dogs often compete to pose. In William Wegman's home, a dog's life is lived within the frame of a photograph.</div>
