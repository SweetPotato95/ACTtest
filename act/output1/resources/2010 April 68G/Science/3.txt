<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">When an asteroid hits the surface of a planet or moon, an impact crater is formed. An asteroid that hits Earth under a specific set of conditions (including speed and angle), referred to here as Set C. forms a crater with a diameter about 20 times the asteroid's diameter. Figure 1 shows the energy released by the impact, for a range of asteroid diameters.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Figure 2 shows the average amount of time that elapses between consecutive impacts on Earth by asteroids with the same diameter, for a range of asteroid diameters. Figure 3 shows the percent of the surface of the Moon, Mercury, and Mars that is covered by impact craters, for various ranges of crater diameter.</div>
