<h1>How Bilingual Speakers Choose Which Language to Use</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">You walk into a clothing <font id=61>store and ask</font> for a dress shirt-a simple enough thing to do. But what if you are a bilingual speaker in a bilingual city such as Miami? How would <font id=62>they</font> decide which language to use? Several <font id=63>subtle, but significant cues, </font> may come into play, suggesting the choice (in this case) of either. Spanish or English. These cues may operate independently, or several may act <font id=64>together. So that they signal</font> language choice.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Such cues may be found in the speaker's immediate surroundings. Hearing a Venezuelan singer's latest recording being played on <font id=65>its</font> sound system might prompt a bilingual speaker to use Spanish. <font id=66>Besides, </font> the language of the speaker's most recent conversation can be the <font id=67>determining factor. </font> For example, if the speaker had been <font id=68>talking</font> in English with a friend before entering the store, he or she might continue to use English to address the store clerk.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=72> [1] Many bilingual teenagers in Miami feel <font id=69>more comfortably</font> speaking English than <font id=70>Spanish; </font> the reverse is often true of their parents. [2] Age can also be an important factor in language choice. [3] Consequently, teenagers may use English if the salesperson is their own age but Spanish (as a sign of respect) if the salesperson belongs to <font id=71>their parents' </font> generation. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=73>A speaker fluent in two languages has distinct advantages over a monolingual speaker. </font> It is common to hear <font id=74>Spanish spoken</font> in Miami's Little Havana, where many Cuban immigrants have settled in recent decades. However, the farther one gets from this area in the city, the more common it is to hear English instead of Spanish. If the clothing store is located relatively far from Little Havana, a bilingual speaker might decide to request the dress shirt in English. Nevertheless, the combination of any of the cues mentioned above could influence the choice, <font id=75>which means that the acquisition of a second language is valuable for anyone wanting to be successful in business. </font></div>
