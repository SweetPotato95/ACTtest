<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from The Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins (?1988 by Richard Dawkins).</div>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The South American and the African weakly elec?tric fish are quite unrelated to each other, but both live in the same kinds of waters in their respective conti?nents, waters that are too muddy for vision to be effective. The physical principle that they exploit-electric fields in water-is even more alien to our conscious?ness than that of bats and dolphins. We at least have a subjective idea of what an echo is, but we have almost no subjective idea of what it might be like to perceive an electric field. We didn't even know of the existence of electricity until a couple of centuries ago.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=32>It is easy to see on the dinner plate that the mus?cles down each side of any fish are arranged as a row of segments, a <font id=37>battery</font> of muscle units. In most fish they contract successively to throw the body into sinuous waves, which propel it forward. In electric fish, both strongly and weakly electric ones, they have become a battery in the electric sense. Each segment (cell) of the battery generates a voltage. These voltages are connected up in series along the length of the fish so that, in a strongly electric fish such as an electric eel, the whole battery generates as much as 1 amp at 650 volts. An electric eel is powerful enough to knock a man out. Weakly electric fish don't need high voltages or currents for their purposes, which are purely information-gathering ones. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The principle of electrolocation, as it has been called, is fairly well understood at the level of physics though not, of course, at the level of what it feels like to be an electric fish. The following account applies equally to African and South American weakly electric fish: the convergence is that thorough. Current flows from the front half of the fish, out into the water in lines that curve back and return to the tail end of the fish. There are not really discrete 'lines' but a continu?ous 'field,' an invisible cocoon of electricity surround?ing the fis's body. However, for human visualization it is easiest to think in terms of a <font id=39>family of curved lines</font> leaving the fish through a series of portholes spaced along the front half of the body, all curving round in the water and diving into the fish again at the tip of its tail. The fish has what amounts to a tiny voltmeter monitor?ing the voltage at each 'porthole.' If the fish is sus?pended in open water with no obstacles around, the lines are smooth curves. The tiny voltmeters at each porthole all register the voltage as 'normal' for their porthole. But if some obstacle appears in the vicinity, say a rock or an item of food, the lines of current that happen to hit the obstacle will be changed. This will change the voltage at any porthole whose current line is affected, and the appropriate voltmeter will register the fact. So in theory a computer, by comparing the pattern of voltages registered by the voltmeters at all the port?holes, could calculate the pattern of obstacles around the fish. This is apparently what the fish brain does. Once again, this doesn't have to mean that the fish are clever mathematicians. They have an apparatus that solves the necessary equations, just as our brains unconsciously solve equations every time we catch a ball.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">It is very important that the fish's own body is kept absolutely rigid. The computer in the head couldn't cope with the extra distortions that would be introduced if the fish's body were bending and twisting like an ordinary fish. Electric fish have, at least twice independently, hit upon this ingenious method of navi?gation, but they have had to pay a price: they have had to give up the normal, highly efficient, fish method of swimming, throwing the whole body into serpentine waves. They have solved the problem by keeping the body stiff as a poker, but they have a single long fin all the way along the length of the body. Then instead of the whole body being thrown into waves, just the long fin is. The fish's progress through the water is rather slow, but it does move, and apparently the sacrifice of fast movement is worth it: the gains in navigation seem to outweigh the losses in speed of swimming. Fascinat?ingly, the South American electric fish have hit upon almost exactly the same solution as the African ones, but not quite. Both groups have developed a single long fin that runs the whole length of the body, but in the African fish it runs along the back whereas in the South American fish it runs along the belly.</div>
