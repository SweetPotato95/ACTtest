<h1>A Peachy Winter Game</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">One <font id=31>winteringly</font> New England day in 1891, a Massachusetts YMCA teacher <font id=32>puzzled over how to handle</font> a difficult situation. Outside, the air was <font id=33>frigid inside, </font> the students were bursting with energy and ignoring their lessons. They were, <font id=34>however, </font> being quite disruptive.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The teacher, James Naismith, was a physical education <font id=35>instructor and</font> an ordained minister. He believed that exercising the body was as important as exercising <font id=36>the mental capacities of</font> the mind. <font id=37>Both, in his opinion</font> nourished the human spirit and build character.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Aware of Naismith's philosophy, a supervisor challenged the instructor to <font id=38>invent</font> an indoor game that would encourage the use of mental and physical skills. He gave Naismith fourteen days to accomplish this task. In tackling his assignment, <font id=39>popular ball game elements were borrowed</font> of the day. <font id=40>The decision of his to start the competition</font> in the center of the playing territory, as in polo. He would place a goal at each end, as in football. A referee would return out-of-bounds balls to the <font id=41>players, </font> as in rugby.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Naismith wanted the goals placed high above the players. This setup would require the players to throw the ball in an arc to make a goal. A janitor gave Naismith two large wooden peach baskets to use as goals. Naismith attached the baskets to a running track elevated ten feet above the gymnasium floor.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Before the start of the first game, Naismith developed thirteen rules to encourage <font id=42>competition the rules reward</font> both physical ability and strategic planning. <font id=43>Instead, he</font> created an indoor game people could play vigorously and competitively, one that exercises body and mind.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">With excitement in the air, Naismith divided his class into two teams. In a historic moment, he tossed the ball straight up at center court. Players then dribbled the ball, aimed at the baskets, and scored <font id=44>points and his</font> students loved the new sport. What had started as a challenge on a winter <font id=45>day had quickly evolved</font> into the first game of basketball.</div>
