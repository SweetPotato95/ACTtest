<h1>Drought-In My Front Yard</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">My house in Santa Fe, New Mexico, was shaded by an enormous blue spruce. It was a tall, elegant tree that kept the house cool <font id=61>summer, if</font> a bit chilly in winter. The tree was not native to the city; rather, it had been transplanted from the mountains east of the city.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Santa Fe is in one of the most arid regions in the United States, but last year conditions were so dry that a drought emergency was declared. We were on strict water rationing, and there was a ban on outdoor watering. <font id=62>62</font> By spring the needles of the blue spruce started to turn brown and <font id=63> were dropped</font> off. I watered it with every precious drop of water I could find. I carried dirty dishwater to the tree. I kept a plastic bucket in the shower and watered the tree <font id=64>in there. </font> All my efforts <font id=65>failed the</font> tree died.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The dead tree was a <font id=66>horrific</font> depressing <font id=67>sight, </font> it continued to shed its dry needles all over the yard. I called an arborist. In my neighborhood, you couldn't simply chop a tree down and yell "Timber!" as it fell. <font id=68>The tree would have to be "topped"-a delicate job. </font> The arborist came and shook his head. "I feel like an undertaker," he said. "Trees are dying all over town." <font id=69>Then he cut off a section at a time and dropped the pieces onto the yard, climbing the old spruce. </font> He counted the rings and told me the tree was fifty years old. Santa Fe's last fifty years had been unusually wet; the next fifty promised not to be.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Without the tree, the front yard changed. <font id=70>70</font> Some <font id=71>cacti, which</font> I'd never given much attention to went wild, blossoming in crimson flowers. Four little pi?on trees-trees <font id=72>more better suited</font> to the conditions of <font id=73>drought-</font>volunteered where the spruce had grown. Best of all was the effect on a dwarf peach tree that had struggled to grow. In the shade of the spruce, it had borne two or three peaches a season. Now in full sunlight, <font id=74>I</font> produced forty. Each peach was succulent-a welcome harvest in a dry season.</div>

I expected the changes would all be for the worse, but pleasantly they weren't.
Should the writer make this addition here?
<div class = "choice">F. Yes, because it gives evidence that, contrary to the arborist's warning, the drought was close to an end.</div>

<div class = "quiz">75. Suppose the writer's goal had been to write a brief persuasive essay describing the devastating effects that poor drought management can have on an area's ecosystem. Would this essay accomplish that goal? Question 75 asks about the preceding passage as a whole.
<div class = "choice">A. Yes, because it effectively uses the example of the dying spruce tree to illustrate the greater devastation to the area.</div>
<div class = "choice">B. Yes, because it criticizes the Santa Fe government's response to the drought for compounding the damage to the surrounding ecosystem.</div>
<div class = "choice">C. No, because it connects the effects on the narrator's yard with climate conditions rather than with drought management practices.</div>
<div class = "choice">D. No, because it fails to connect the area's drought to the death of the blue spruce tree.</div>
