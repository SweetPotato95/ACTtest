<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">A river's discharge is the volume of river water flowing past a location in the river in a given amount of time. Discharge is affected by several factors, including the area of the river's drainage basin (the land surface that delivers the rainwater that falls on it into the river) and the spatial relationship of the river to other rivers.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Two studies examined the discharge in 3 rivers-the North River, the Jones River, and the Calm River-following a rainfall event. As shown in Figure 1, the drainage basin of the North River and the drainage basin of the Jones River are within the drainage basin of the Calm River. The area of each river's drainage basin is given in<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 April 67F\imgs\223.png' width = '120'height = '34'/>.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The rainfall event produced 25 mm of rain. As rainwater drained into the 3 rivers, the discharges of the rivers increased. The maximum discharge measured immediately after a rainfall event is called a flood.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Over the 12 days following the rainfall event, as the flood caused by the rainfall moved downstream, the discharge was continuously measured, in<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 April 67F\imgs\225.png' width = '74'height = '34'/>, at the 3 sites shown in Figure 1. The results are shown in Figure 2. (Note: No rainfall event occurred in the Calm River drainage basin during those 12 days.)</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The normalized discharge over the 12 days following the rainfall event was calculated for each of the 3 rivers. The normalized discharge values allowed the flood to be studied as if the 3 rivers had identical drainage basin areas of 1<img src='file:\$$$\resources\2011 April 67F\imgs\226.png' width = '46'height = '32'/>. Each normalized discharge value was calculated using the following equation:</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The value of the numerator, the river discharge, was obtained from Figure 2. The results are shown in Figure 3.</div>
