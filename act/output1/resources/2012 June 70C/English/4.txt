<h1>Tracking Time through Winter Counts</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Lakota artist Emil Her Many Horses became fascinated by Lakota winter <font id=46>counts. While</font> he was working on an exhibit for the National Museum of the American Indian in 2001 "Winter counts" are <font id=47>pictorially</font> calendars that record, or count, the years by representing each year with a single picture. They're called winter counts because the Lakota measured a year from the first snowfall of one winter to the first snowfall of the next. Many surviving winter counts date from the nineteenth century and were drawn onto buffalo hides.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Each band or extended family group within the larger tribe kept <font id=48>its</font> own winter count. A council of elders <font id=49>will decide</font> which event the year should be remembered <font id=50>for such as, a crucial, buffalo hunt, </font> the death of a great chief, or a dramatic meteor shower. <font id=51>Over time, </font> a count would accumulate dozens of pictures that, arranged in rows or in a spiral, told the people's story.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Her Many Horses was inspired to revive the historical practice and <font id=52>creating</font> a new winter count for his own family. <font id=53>Likewise, he</font> talked about what <font id=54>to his relatives</font> had been important to them in the past year. Together, <font id=55>we</font> decided that the first year of their count should be remembered as "The Year Many Ceremonies Were Held at Wakpamani Lake." One of these ceremonies involved his niece throwing a handmade beaded ball, so Her Many Horses drew a picture showing a young woman in traditional dress tossing a ball. By becoming the family's winter count keeper, Her Many Horses took on the role of historian and storyteller. <font id=56>56</font> Thus, a winter count is <font id=57>essentially: a tool</font> for remembering. Each image brings to mind a cascade of stories and memories. History stays alive in the telling, as previous keepers must <font id=58>understand</font> each time they looked at the pictures on their winter count and started to speak. <font id=59> "It was the year that Walks Far brought back the gray horse with eagle feathers braided into its tailâ€¦" </font></div>
