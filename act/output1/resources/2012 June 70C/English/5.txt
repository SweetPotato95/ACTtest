<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=61>It was once</font> limited to the humble role of indicator light on devices such as TVs and radios, the light-emitting <font id=62>diode, or LED, </font> has emerged as a versatile, energy-efficient, and aesthetically pleasing source of illumination. <font id=63>63</font> Designers today are using LEDs to create signs, displays, and area lighting that are both alluring and functional. [A]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[2]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Long past are the days when LEDs-semiconductor diodes that produce light when electrical current is properly applied- <font id=64>could</font> generate only a low-intensity red light. Modern LEDs can be made to produce any color, including white; can be manufactured to generate infrared or ultraviolet light instead of visible light; and are able to <font id=65>yield</font> a high light output</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[3]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">LEDs operate on extremely low voltages relative to standard (incandescent) bulbs. They also directly convert electrical current into light, thus eliminating the need to waste energy on first heating a filament that then radiates light. [B] In addition, LEDs last <font id=66>far</font> longer than standard <font id=67>bulbs. </font> Whereas a typical 75-watt incandescent bulb works for 750 <font id=68>hours. </font> LEDs can endure up to 50,000 hours of use. <font id=69>As the case may be, </font> LEDs are small, shock resistant, and (unlike another often-touted alternative light source, compact fluorescent bulbs) <font id=70>mercury free. </font> [C]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[4]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Commercial designers are among those <font id=71>rushing to catch up in their</font> LED use. The ceiling of an Atlantic City, New Jersey, shopping arcade supports 2,000 small color-changing LED nodes <font id=72>strung</font> on overhead cables to create the <font id=73>allusion of</font> a star field. [D] In Sweden, students programmed color-changing LED projectors to turn a small grove of trees into a "cathedral of light." LED road signs can consist of nothing more than block letters flashing out simple messages; they can, however, be as elaborate as giant billboards displaying vibrant full-color images</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[5]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">LEDs <font id=74>are innovative</font>-they're costlier to manufacture than incandescents and are vulnerable to temperature extremes-but they offer numerous advantages over traditional lighting. The LED is a young technology with a bright future</div>
