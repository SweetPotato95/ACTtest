<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from the article "The Image Culture" by Christine Rosen (○C2005 by Ethics and Public Policy Center).</div>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The creator of one of the earliest technologies of the image named his invention, appropriately enough, for himself. Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre, a French-man known for his elaborate and whimsical stage design in the. Paris theater, began building on the work of Joseph Nicéphore Niepce to try to produce a fixed image. Daguerre called the image he created in 1837 the "daguerreotype." He made extravagant claims for his device. It is "not merely an instrument which serves to draw nature," he wrote in 1838, it "gives her the power to reproduce herself.'</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Despite its technological crudeness and often-spectral images, the daguerreotype was eerily effective at capturing glimmers of personality in its fixed portraits. The extant daguerreotypes of well-known Americans in the nineteenth century include: a young and serious Abraham Lincoln, sans beard: an affable Horace Greeley in stovepipe hat; and a dour picture of the suffragist Lucy Stone. A daguerreotype of Edgar Allan Poe, taken in 1848, depicts the writer with a baleful expression and crossed arms, and was taken not long before Poe was found delirious and near death on the streets of Baltimore.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">But the daguerreotype did more than capture the posture of a poised citizenry. It also changed artists' perceptions of human nature. Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1851 Gothic romance, The House of the Seven Gables, has an ancient moral ("the wrong-doing of one generation lives into the successive ones") but made use of a modern technology, daguerreotyping, to unspool its story about the unmasking of festering, latent evil. In the story, Holgrave, the strange lodger living in the gabled house, is a daguerreotypist (as well as a political radical) who says of his art: "While we give it credit only for depicting the merest surface, it actually brings out the secret character with a truth no painter would ever venture upon, even could he detect it." It is Holgrave's silvery daguerreotypes that eventually reveal the nefarious motives of Judge Pyncheon-and in so doing suggest that the camera could expose human character more acutely than the eye.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Author Oliver Wendell Holmes called the photo the <font id=29> "mirror with a memory," </font> and in 1859 predicted that the "image would become more important than the object itself and would in fact make the object disposable." But praise for the photograph was not universal.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=25>In her elegant extended essay On Photography, the late Susan Sontag argues that images-particularly photographs-carry the risk of undermining true things so and genuine experiences, as well as the danger of upending our understanding of art, "Knowing a great deal about what is in the world (art, catastrophe, the beauties of nature) through photographic images," Sontag notes, "people are frequently disappointed. surprised, unmoved when they see the real thing." This is not a new problem, of course; it plagued the art world when the printing process allowed the mass reproduction of great works of art, and its effects can still be seen whenever one overhears a museum-goer express disappointment that the Van Gogh he sees hanging on the wall is nowhere near as vibrant as the one on his coffee mug. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">But Sontag's point is broader, and suggests that photography has forced us to consider that exposure to images does not necessarily create understanding of the things themselves. Images do not necessarily lead to meaning; the information they convey does not always lead to knowledge. This is due in part to the fact that photographic images must constantly be refreshed if one's attention is to continue to be drawn to them. "Photographs shock insofar as they show something novel," Sontag argues. "Unfortunately, the ante keeps getting raised-partly through the very proliferation of such images of horror." Images, Sontag concludes, have turned the world "into a department store or museum-without-walls," a place where people "become customers or tourists of reality."</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Nevertheless, photographs still retain some of the magical allure that the earliest daguerreotypes inspired. As W. J. T. Mitchell observes in What Do Pictures Want? "When students scoff at the idea of a magical relation between a picture and what it represents, ask them to take a photograph of their mother and blank out the eyes." Photographs remain powerful because they are reminders of the people and things we care about. They are surrogates carried into battle by a soldier or by a traveler on holiday. They exist to remind us of the absent, the beloved, and the dead.</div>
