<h1>Sculpting History's Heroes</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Tina Allen's bronze sculptures are striking for their powerful combination of monumental size and detail. Allen created large statues to <font id=1>acknowledge</font> the historical <font id=2>contributions' </font> of African Americans. Her statue of Sojourner <font id=3>Truth: </font> a nineteenth-century abolitionist and women's rights advocate, stands twelve feet tall and weighs two tons. Her thirteen-foot-tall depiction of Roots author Alex Haley <font id=4>weighs</font> five tons. <font id=5>As famous as she is, </font> Allen captured each figure with lifelike precision.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">For these sculptures, Allen used the "lost wax" process. In this ancient techniques, the sculpture is first carved in clay; the clay is then covered with rubber to <font id=6>make the creation of</font> a mold. The rubber mold is carefully removed from the clay and filled with wax. After the wax <font id=7>was cooled</font> and the rubber is discarded, <font id=8>that one</font> is touched up to mirror the clay original. The wax statue is then coated with liquid ceramic, which hardens over <font id=9>several days. </font> When the ceramic mold is fired in a kiln, the wax burns out of the mold, leaving the empty ceramic shell-thus the name "lost wax" process. The statue is then completed by filling the empty ceramic shell with molten bronze and breaking away the shell once the bronze has cooled.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=10>Allen became interested in painting and sculpting as a young girl. </font> She took over four years to complete the Alex Haley Memorial in Tennessee, <font id=11>in his hands</font> which portrays Haley seated with an open book. For <font id=12>some</font> Sojourner Truth statue in Michigan, Allen spent more than a year on the clay model alone. <font id=13>13</font> To mimic the coarse fabric in Truth's dress, <font id=14>for which Allen pounded</font> the clay with a mallet covered with chicken wire. She also used a delicate paintbrush to create the small wrinkles on Truth's hands.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Like many of her works, the statues of Truth and Haley are displayed in public <font id=15>because Allen wanted to make the accomplishments of African Americans visible in everyone's day-to-day lives. </font> She also wanted to speak directly to African Americans through her art, characterizing as a way of "writing our history in bronze."</div>
