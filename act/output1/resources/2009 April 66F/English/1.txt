<h1>Antarctic Adventure</h1>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In February 2001, polar adventurers Liv <font id=1>Arnesen of Norway, and Ann Bancroft</font> of Minnesota became the first women to climb and ski across the continent of Antarctica. The two former schoolteachers <font id=2>completed</font> their 2,400-mile journey in 96 days.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[1] Months before their expedition, Arnesen and Bancroft began training by learning to ski behind sails-parachute-like devices that can pull a skier loaded with supplies about six miles per hour in steady winds. [2} On November 13,2000, the pair boarded a small plane in South Africa and took a six-hour flight to Blue One <font id=3>Runway, it is</font> a solid-ice airstrip on the Atlantic coast of Antarctica. [3] They set out soon after landing. [4] Hiking unassisted up the 10,000-foot-high Sygyn Glacier, <font id=4>and</font> each woman pulled a sled that weighed more than 260 pounds. <font id=5>[5] The sleds carried all the women's supplies, including a tent, a one-burner camp stove, diaries, two sets of skis, a laptop computer, and a snow shovel.</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">By December 1, the adventurers had skied onto the Polar Plateau, <font id=6>stretching for 1,000 miles</font> a high, frozen desert. The first week, strong winds <font id=7>had blew</font> daily, and <font id=8>the team</font> sailed 210 miles in just five days. For the next five days, <font id=9>accordingly,</font> there was almost no wind, and the pair sailed only 34 miles. No matter how hard the women skied, daily mileage typically depended upon wind direction and intensity.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">On January 16, Arnesen and Bancroft reached the South Pole, where they visited with <font id=10>scientists and replenished their</font> food supply. In order to safely descend the glacier's sharp ice, the women attached mountaineer spikes to their boots. Two days later, they were again in bitter cold, <font id=11>and while climbing</font> over a 10,200-foot-high glacier named Titan Dome.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Fortunately, the wind was with them the final few miles, <font id=12>and during those last miles of the trip,</font> they were able to ski off the continent itself and onto the Ross Ice Shelf.<font id=13>13</font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Although the adventurers had planned to continue across the ice shelf to McMurdo Station, 460 miles away on the Pacific coast, the winds did not cooperate. To avoid becoming stranded when winter arrived, the women called a ski plane <font id=14>prudently</font> to airlift them to McMurdo.</div>
