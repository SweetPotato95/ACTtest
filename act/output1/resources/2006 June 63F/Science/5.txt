<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">In a study of human sleep cycles, subjects in 4 different age groups performed a brief mental task at a scheduled time. Immediately following the task, their oral temperatures were taken and then the time for each subject to fall asleep was measured.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">The results were averaged for each group. Figure 1 shows how the average time to fall asleep for the 4 groups varied with the time of day that the task was performed. Figure 2 shows how the average oral temperature .of 2 of the groups varied with the .time of day that the task was performed.</div>
