<h1>Prairie Eye, Woods Eye</h1>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[1]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">As I was growing up in the Midwest, two landscapes made vivid impressions on my mind. The flat, <font id=46>open, Illinois, prairie</font> allowed me to drink in huge vistas. The enclosed pine woods of Wisconsin, where my family vacationed, gave me comfort. Both prairie and woods were dear to me and important to the development of <font id=47>one's</font> interactions with the world.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[2]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">I'm not talking just about a landscape's familiarity but also about a way in which a landscape's impression on the mind can affect the way one thinks and feels. Midwestern writer Bill Holm distinguishes between a "prairie eye" and a "woods eye." The prairie eye "looks for distance, clarity, and light," as well as openness and harsh truth. <font id=48>The woods eye looks for "closeness, complexity, and darkness," the mysterious and the hidden. </font> Holm claims <font id=49>at having</font> a prairie eye, feeling uncomfortable in enclosed, mysterious spaces like the <font id=50>woods, he</font> prefers the "magnitude and delicacy" of the open prairie.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[3]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">My prairie eye and my woods eye are <font id=51>equally dominant in terms of strength. </font> When I lived in Michigan a few years ago, I marveled at the complexity and mystery of the woody patches everywhere. At the same time, when I would drive in rural areas, I felt joyful <font id=52>52</font>. I would be intrigued and curious as I looked a mile ahead to spy a lone cart tiny and far away, <font id=53>whether it came</font> to a stop on a straight road.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[4]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">My woods eye and prairie eye provide <font id=54>varied and different</font> reactions to more than just landscape, and these perspectives apply <font id=55>to</font> my other interests as well. I revel in the dark maze of a 500-page Victorian novel, yet I also appreciate the delicate beauty of a three-line Japanese haiku. I savor each competing taste in a pizza with everything, <font id=56>yet</font> I also enjoy a simple glass of water.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[5]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">My <font id=57>tastes' </font> are similarly diverse, whether in art, Iiterature, music, movies, TV shows, or <font id=58>long walks are enjoyed. </font> My woods eye and prairie eye <font id=59>doesn't compete</font> for dominance. Instead, they help me enjoy a range of experiences.</div>
