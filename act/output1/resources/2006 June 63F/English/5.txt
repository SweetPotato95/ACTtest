<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=61>Walking</font> through any one of an increasing number of vegetable gardens these days and you're likely to shake your head in disbelief. Growing within many plots are such <font id=62>oddities, </font> as purple carrots, white tomatoes, striped eggplants, potatoes with blue flesh, and other crops a casual gardener would find strange indeed.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[2]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">"Seed savers," the people who nurture these rare and endangered vegetables, value the plants for more than their unusual appearance. Many of the plants are heirloom varieties <font id=63>whose</font> seeds have been privately passed from one generation to the next Others are once-popular commercial varieties that are no longer available through any seed company. <font id=64>All represent genetic strains in danger of extinction. </font></div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[3]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=66>Because vegetable seeds must be planted every three or four years to maintain their viability, these rare varieties will be lost forever <font id=65>unless</font> they are not kept alive by a network of dedicated gardeners. </font> Many seed savers order endangered plants through a <font id=67>small; but growing</font> number of organizations <font id=68>that specialize</font> in rare seeds. <font id=69>By now, </font> the seed-saving gardeners agree to grow the plants and then offer the new seeds to ocher equally concerned growers.</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=73> [1] Seed savers point out that the world's food supply depends on <font id=70>fewer than</font> two dozen species of plants, nearly all of which are being reduced to only a few varieties through the use of hybrids and plant genetics. [2] That lack of variety <font id=71>had made</font> the plants more vulnerable to rapid climate change, insects, and disease, [3] Because of the plants' nearly identical genetic <font id=72>heritage, and</font> a blight spread easily through Ireland's entire potato crop [4] The Irish potato famine of the nineteenth century is just one example of the dangers of such genetic homogenization. </font></div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">[5]</div>

<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">While it may seem as if seed savers are doing nothing more than planting their gardens, <font id=74>in conclusion</font> they are doing nothing less than ensuring the future of the world's food supply: Future generations may one day thank them for their seed-saving efforts.</div>
