Passage VI
The concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) in river water affects the fish in the river. Many freshwater fish species, including crappie, perch, and bass, require a minimum average DO concentration of 5 parts per million (ppm) to thrive. Other fish, such as carp and gar, can tolerate average DO concentrations as low as 3 ppm. Table 1 shows the DO concentration at saturation for water at various temperatures. Figures 1 and 2 show the measured changes in a river’s water temperature and DO concentration, respectively, over a 24-hour period in midsummer. Table 2 shows how the DO concentration affects fish species in a river.

31. River water is often used in industrial processed and is then returned to the river much warmer than when it was removed. Based only on the information in Table 1, why would this warmed water be a potential danger to fish populations? The warmed river water most likely has:
A. a higher DO concentration than does the cooler river water.
B. a lower DO concentration that does the cooler river water.
C. the same DO concentration as does the cooler river water.
D. a DO concentration of zero.
32. According to Figure 1 and Figure 2, which of the following best describes what happens to the water temperature and the DO concentration between 2 A.M. and 7 A.M.?
<u>Water temperature</u>     <u>DO concentration</u>
F. Steadily increases   Remains the same
G. Steadily decreases  Steadily decreases
H. Remains the same  Remains the same
J. Remains the same   Steadily increases
33. According to Table 1 and Table 2, river water at a temperature in which of the following ranges would most likely have a low enough DO concentration to endanger most fish species living in that water?
A. Less than 25℃  B. Between 25℃ and 30℃
C. Between 30℃ and 35℃  D. Greater than 35℃
34. Which of the following graphs best represents the relationship between water temperature and DO concentration at saturation shown in Table 1?

35. According to Figure 1 and Figure 2, what were the measured water temperature and DO concentration of the river water at 10 P.M.?
A. 21℃ and 9.3 ppm  B. 22℃ and 9.3 ppm  C. 22℃ and 9.2 ppm  D. 23℃ and 9.1 ppm
