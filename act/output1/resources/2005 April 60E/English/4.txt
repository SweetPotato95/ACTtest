<h1>Maya Lin: Her Work</h1>
<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=46>To the surprise of many, </font> it was a college <font id=47>student, Maya Lin</font> who won the 1981 competition to design the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Although Lin's nonrepresentational design initially stirred up a controversy, the completed monument has won widespread acclaim <font id=48>for a while now. </font> Visitors to the monument in Washington, D.C., encounter two long black granite walls that meet at an angle as they cut into the ground. Inscribed in the highly polished walls are the 'names of the more than 58,000 United States military personnel lost in the war.</div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;"><font id=57>While some sculptors suggest the magnitude of an event by presenting larger-than-life <font id=49>figures, </font> Lin relies on more understated methods to suggest matters of great significance. <font id=50>50</font> <font id=52>Since the unveiling of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Lin <font id=51>has applied</font> this approach in different parts of the country and to different eras of United States history. </font> In 1988, she designed a memorial to honor individuals killed in the civil rights movement. <font id=54>Located in Montgomery, Alabama, <font id=53>Maya Lin made this-work consist</font> of a low granite disk on which the names of the dead appear along with references to landmark events of the movement. In addition, my research turned up the following information. </font> Behind the disk stands a granite wall bearing <font id=55>their</font> inscription "...UNTIL JUSTICE ROLLS DOWN LIKE WATERS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS LIKE A MIGHTY STREAM." Lin selected these words from <font id=56>a Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speech, </font> and in the monument, water flows down the wall, over Dr. King's words, and out from the center of the disk. </font></div>

<br>
<div class = "para" style = "font-size: 16;font-family:Microsoft YAHEI;">Lin continues to challenge herself in a career that combines an appreciation for sculpture, architecture; and the <font id=58>complexity</font> of human experience. A public library in Ohio, a chapel in Pennsylvania, a train station in New York-these <font id=59>had been</font> only some of the places that have been influenced by Maya Lin. It is possible to come away from her work with the sense that the distinctions we sometimes make between public and personal life are blurred in moments of genuine reflection.</div>
