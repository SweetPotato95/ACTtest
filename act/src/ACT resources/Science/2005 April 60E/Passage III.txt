Passage III
As a living cell’s surface area-to-volume ratio (S/V) increases. so does the cell’s ability to exchange substances with its environment.
To model this exchange process different-sized cubes of gelatin were immersed in a dye for 1 minute. Table 1 lists the edge length, surface area, volume, S/V, and percent volume of gelatin that was dyed.

Table 2 lists the diameter and surface area of 5 types of spherical ova (egg cells).
