Passage IV
Some students were interested in why antifreeze is mixed with the H<sub>2</sub>O in a car’s radiator. They knew that when a substance is dissolved in H<sub>2</sub>O, the boiling points are elevated and the freezing points are lowered relative to H<sub>2</sub>O. They performed the following experiments to investigate the effects of the addition of ethylene glycol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), the active ingredient in most types of antifreeze, to H<sub>2</sub>O.
Experiment l
Six solutions of various concentrations of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in H<sub>2</sub>O were prepared. The mass of 10.00 mL of each solution was measured, and the density of each solution was calculated using the following formula:

The densities of 100% H<sub>2</sub>O and 100% C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were also determined. The students found that as the concentration of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased, the density of the solution increased.
Experiment 2
A 20 mL sample of H<sub>2</sub>O was placed in a flask containing a thermometer and the flask was heated. The temperature at which the H<sub>2</sub>O first started to boil was recorded as the boiling point. This procedure was repeated with C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the solutions prepared in Experiment l (see Figure l).

Experiment 3
A 90 g sample of H<sub>2</sub>O (freezing point= 0℃) and 10 g of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (freezing point = -11.5℃) were placed in a cup containing a thermometer. The mixture .was stirred as it was cooled in a low-temperature bath. The temperature at which ice crystals first began to appear was recorded as the freezing point. The procedure was repeated with different amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (see Table l).

19. If Experiment 2 were repeated with an aqueous solution containing 80% C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by mass, the boiling point of the solution would most likely be:
A. less than 100℃.    B. between 100℃ and 110℃.    C. between 110℃ and 115℃.
D. greater than 115℃.
20. Where the students live, the lowest temperature during the past year was -31℃. Based on the results of Experiment 3, which of the following percents, by mass, of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in H<sub>2</sub>O would have been necessary to be sure that the mixtures in car radiators in this area did not freeze?
F. 20%        G. 30%     H. 40%         J. 50%
21. Based on the results of 10:00 mL of which of the following aqueous solutions would be the greatest?
A. 10% C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>   B. 20% C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>   C. 30% C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>    D. 40% C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
22. A student repeating Experiment 3 placed an aqueous mixture containing 65 0-10 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the low-temperature bath. She did not observe the formation of any crystals. Which of the following statements best explains this observation?
F. The temperature of the low-temperature bath was exactly the same as the mixture’s freezing point.
G. The temperature of the low-temperature bath was higher than the mixture’s freezing point.
H. The temperature of the low-temperature bath was lower than the mixture’s freezing point.
J. The mixture will not freeze and therefore has no freezing point.
23. Based on the results of Experiment 2, why would it be better to use a mixture of antifreeze and H<sub>2</sub>O rather than pure H<sub>2</sub>O in a car radiator during hot weather? The mixture has a:
A. higher boiling point than pure H<sub>2</sub>O.         B. lower boiling point than pure H<sub>2</sub>O.
C. higher freezing point than pure H<sub>2</sub>O.        D. lower freezing point than pure H<sub>2</sub>O.
24. Based on the passage and the results of Experiment 2. which of the following types of water would most likely have the lowest boiling point?
F. Lake water     G. Distilled water     H. Salt water      J. Tap water
